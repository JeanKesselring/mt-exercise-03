i had a parakeet when i was a kid , that was the only pet that i really enjoyed . we used to let him out of his cage , and he would fly around and my mother had built , one entire wall of our living room was <UNK> . she felt this gives you a feeling of space . have you ever heard this <UNK> design <UNK> that a mirror makes it seem like you have an entire other room ? what kind of a jerk walks up to a mirror and goes , `` hey look , there 's a whole <UNK> room in there . there 's a guy in there looks just like me . '' but the parakeet will fall for this , you 'll let him out of his cage , he flies around the room , bang ! with his little head , he would just go <UNK> ' ohh ! and i 'd always think , even if he thinks the mirror is another room , why does n't he at least try to avoid hitting the other parakeet ?

lady : ( noticing the dot ) what 's this ?
what causes homophobia ? what is it that makes a heterosexual man worry ? i think it 's because men know that deep down we have weak sales resistance . we're constantly buying shoes that hurt us , pants that do n't fit right . men think , '' obviously i can be talked into anything . what if i accidentally wander into some sort of homosexual store , thinking it 's a shoe store , and the salesman goes , 'just hold this guy 's hand , walk around the store a little bit , see how you feel . no obligation , no pressure , just try it . would you like to see him in a sandal ?

jerry : 'lemon tree '
jerry : i have to tell you that i did some very exciting news recently , and i do n't know if i should really tell you exactly what it is because it 's really not a definite thing yet . well , i will tell you what i know so far . according to the information that i have in the envelope that i 've received , it seems that i may have already won some very valuable prizes . well , thank you , thank you very much , well thank you . it 's very nice to hear that . but , in all honesty , i have to say , i did n't even know i was in this thing . but , according to the readout , it looks like i am among the top people that they are considering . you know , that 's what annoys me about the sweepstakes companies , they always tease you with that , `` you may have already won . '' i 'd like once for a sweepstakes company to have some guts , come out with the truth , just tell people the truth one time . send out envelopes , `` you have definitely lost ! '' you turn it over , giant printing , `` not even close ! '' you open it up , there 's this whole letter of explanation , `` even we can not believe how badly you 've done in this contest . ''
elaine : the truth ! , you want the truth ?
jerry : that would be an interesting sociological experiment . you know , kramer has his father 's band . he 'd loan it to you .
elaine : ( to jerry ) i do have one teeny little problem , though .
people would n't get off the phone .
whatever . anyway , it was fun . it was , erm , it was fun , so , oh boy , uhm , so ,

elaine : so listen , what should i do ? i mean if i break up with him now <UNK> look like i 'm <UNK> him because of his <UNK> , i 'll be <UNK> from the community .

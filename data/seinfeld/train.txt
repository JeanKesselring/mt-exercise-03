( morty finally gets it . so jerry goes on quieter ) we 've tried all kind of <UNK> , but we ca n't seem to be friend when we sleep together .
what causes homophobia ? what is it that makes a heterosexual man worry ? i think it 's because men know that deep down we have weak sales resistance . we're constantly buying shoes that hurt us , pants that do n't fit right . men think , '' obviously i can be talked into anything . what if i accidentally wander into some sort of homosexual store , thinking it 's a shoe store , and the salesman goes , 'just hold this guy 's hand , walk around the store a little bit , see how you feel . no obligation , no pressure , just try it . would you like to see him in a sandal ?

stand up ========= to me , going to the health club , you see all these people and they're working out , and they 're training and they 're getting in shape but the strange thing is nobody is really getting in shape for anything . the only reason that you 're getting in shape is that so you can get through the <UNK> . so we 're working out , so that we 'll be in shape , for when we have to do our <UNK> . this is the whole thing . the other thing i do n't get about it , is why we 're so careful about locking up our dirty towels and smelly <UNK> . what exactly is the black market on these disgusting gym clothes ? i give my car to any valet guy in front of a <UNK> because he has a short red jacket , yeah he must be the valet guy , i do n't even think about it but my <UNK> , <UNK> gym clothes , i got one of these locks you could put a <UNK> through it and it wo n't open . that stuff is safe .

kramer : let me get a glass of water . ( heads tward the sink )
george : who do i like ? i , like , uh , art , vandelay .
i had a parakeet when i was a kid , that was the only pet that i really enjoyed . we used to let him out of his cage , and he would fly around and my mother had built , one entire wall of our living room was <UNK> . she felt this gives you a feeling of space . have you ever heard this <UNK> design <UNK> that a mirror makes it seem like you have an entire other room ? what kind of a jerk walks up to a mirror and goes , `` hey look , there 's a whole <UNK> room in there . there 's a guy in there looks just like me . '' but the parakeet will fall for this , you 'll let him out of his cage , he flies around the room , bang ! with his little head , he would just go <UNK> ' ohh ! and i 'd always think , even if he thinks the mirror is another room , why does n't he at least try to avoid hitting the other parakeet ?

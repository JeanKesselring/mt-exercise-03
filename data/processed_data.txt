jerry : i 'm always in traffic with the lane expert . you know this type of person ? constantly reevaluating their lane choice .. never quite sure , `` is this the best lane for
me ? for my life ? '' they 're always a little bit ahead of you , `` can i get in over there ? could i get in over here ? could i get in there ? '' `` yeah , come on over here , pal .
we 're zoomin ' over here . this is the secret lane , nobody knows about it .. '' the ultimate , i think the ultimate psychological test of traffic is the total dead stop . not
even rolling . and you look out the window , you can see gum clearly . so we know that in the future traffic will get even worse than that . i mean , what will happen ?
will it start moving backwords , i wonder ? i mean , is that possible ? that someday we 'll be going `` boy , this is some really bad traffic now , boy . this , is really bad .
i 'm gon na try to get off and get back on going the other way . ''

jerry : no , of course not .
george : people break up all the time .
jerry : everyday .
george : it just did n't work out . what can i do ? i wanted to love her . i tried to love her . i could n't .
jerry : you tried .
george : i kept looking at her face . i 'd go : `` c'mon , love her . love her ! ''
jerry : did you tell her you loved her ?
george : oh , i had no choice . she squeezed it out of me ! she 'd tell me she loved me . alright , at first , i just look at her . i 'd go `` oh , really ? '' or `` boy , that 's , that 's
something . '' but , eventually you have to come back with `` well , i love you . '' you know , you can only hold out for so long ! ''
jerry : you 're a human being .
george : and i did n't even ask her out . she asked me out first . she called me up . what was i supposed to do ? say no ? i ca n't do that to someone .
jerry : you 're too nice a guy .
george : i am . i 'm a nice guy .. ( realizing ) and she seduced me ! we were in my apartment , i 'm sitting on the couch , she 's on the chair - i get up to go to the
bathroom , i come back , she 's on the couch . what am i supposed to do ? not do anything ? i could n't do that . i would 've insulted her .
jerry : you 're flesh and blood .
george : i had nothing to do wtih any of this ! i met all her friends , i did n't want to meet them . i kept trying to avoid it . i knew it would only get me in deeper . but
they were everywhere ! they kept popping up , all over the place . `` this is nancy , this is susan , this is amy .. this is my cousin .. this is my brother .. thisis my father . ''
it 's like i 'm in quicksand .
jerry : i told you when i met her ..
george : my back is killing me .
jerry : you got ta go to my chiropractor , he 's the best .
george : oh yeah , everybody 's guy is the best .
jerry : i 'm gon na make an appointment for you . we 'll go together .
george : please . they do n't do anything .. look , do i have to break up with her in person ? ca n't i do it over the phone ? i have no stomach for these things .
jerry : you should just do it like a band-aid . one motion ! right off !
( car door opens , it 's elaine )
elaine : hi .
jerry : hi .

george : i 'm letting you in .
elaine : oh no . no . i do n't want to sit in the back . i 'll be left out of the conversation .
george : no , you wo n't .
elaine : yes , i will , george . i 'll have to sick my chin on top of the seat .
george : okay ..
( george gets out , and gestures for elaine to sit in the seat )
elaine : why ca n't you sit in the middle ?
george : please , it does n't look good . boy , boy , girl .
elaine : i think you 're afraid to sit next to a man . you 're a little homophobic , are n't you ?
george : is it that obvious ?
( elaine sits in the middle )
elaine : hello , jerry .
jerry : hello .
elaine : did you get a haircut ?
jerry : no , shower . so , where are we eating ?
elaine : tell me if you think this is strange : there 's this guy who lives in my building , who i was introduced to a couple of years ago by a friend . he 's a teacher , or
something . anyway , after we met , whenever we 'd run into each other on the street , or in the lobby , or whatever , we would stop and we would chat a little .. nothing
much . little pleasantries . he was a nice guy , he 's got a family .. then after a while , i noticed there was not more stopping . just saying hello and continuing on our way .
and then the verbal hellos stopped , and we just went into these little sort of nods of recognition . so , fine . i figure , that 's where this relationship is finally gon na settle :
polite nodding . then one day , he does n't nod . like i do n't exist ? ! he went from nods to nothing .
george : ( imitating tony bennett ) `` you know , i 'd go from nods to nothing .. ''
elaine : and now , there 's this intense animosity whenever we passs . i mean , it 's like we really hate each other . it 's based on nothing .
jerry : a relationship is an organism . you created this thing and then you starved it so it turned against you . same thing happened to the blob .
george : i think you absolutely have to say something to this guy . confront him .
elaine : really ?
george : yes .
elaine : you would do that ?
george : if i was a different person .

george : i told her . in the kitchen - which was risky 'cause it 's near all the knives . i started with the word `` listen . ''
jerry : ah ha .
george : i said , `` listen marlene , '' and then the next thing i know , i 'm in the middle of it . and there 's this voice inside of me going : `` you 're doing it ! you 're doing
it ! '' and then she started to cry , and i weakened a bit . i almost relented , but the voice , jerry . the voice said `` keep going , keep going . you 're almost out ! '' it 's like i
was making a prison break , you know . and i 'm heading for the wall , and i trip and i twist my ankle , and they throw the light on you , you know . so , somehow i get
though the crying and i keep running . then the cursing started . she 's firing at me from the guard tower : `` son of a bang ! son of a boom ! '' i get to the top of the wall -
the front door . i opened it up , i 'm one foot away , i took one last look around the penitentiary , and i jumped !
jerry : see , it 's never as bad as you imagine .
kramer : i liked marlene . what 's her number ?
george : no , i , i do n't think so .

jerry : it 's very good cantaloupe . ( changing subject ) so that 's it ? you 're out ?
george : except for one small problem . i left some books in her apartment .
jerry : so , go get them .
george : oh , no . no , i ca n't go back there . jerry , it 's so awkward and , you know , it could be dangerous - sexually . something could happen , i 'd be right back
where i started .
jerry : so forget about the books . did you read them ?
george : well , yeah .
jerry : what do you need them for ?
george : i do n't know . they 're books .
jerry : what is this obsession people have with books ? they put them in their houses - like they 're trophies . what do you need it for after you read it ?

had like three lunches and a movie . and she never stops calling . ( george nods - he knows exactly what jerry 's talking about ) and it 's these meaningless ,
purposeless , blather calls . she never asks if i 'm busy or anything . i just pick up the phone and she 's in the middle of a sentence .
george : that 's standard . has she left you one of those messages where she uses up the whole machine ?
jerry : ohh .. you know , and sometimes she 'll go , `` hello , jerry ? '' and i 'll go `` oh , hi marlene . '' and then it 's `` jerry .. ''
george : what about getting off the phone ?

room , they 're going to use it . they 've got it . it 's all set up for you to wait . and you sit there , you know , and you 've got your little magazine . you pretend you 're
reading it , but you 're really looking at the other people . you know , you 're thinking about about them things like `` i wonder what he 's got . as soon as she goes , i 'm
getting her magazine . '' and then , they finally call you and it 's a very exciting moment . they finally call you , and you stand up and you kinda look around at the other
people in the room . `` well , i guess i 've been chosen . i 'll see you all later . '' you know , so you think you 're going to see the doctor , but you 're not , are you ? no .
you 're going into the next waiting room . the littler waiting room . but if they are , you know , doing some sort of medical thing to you , you want to be in the smallest
room that they have , i think . you do n't wnat to be in the largest room that they have . you know what i mean ? you ever see these operating theaters , that they have ,
with like , stadium seating ? you do n't want them doing antying to you that makes other doctors go , `` i have to see this ! '' `` are you kidding ? are they really gon na do
that to him ? '' `` are there seats ? can we get in ? '' do they scalp tickets to these things ? `` i got two for the winslow tumor , i got two .. ''

jerry : seriously , do you wnat to switch chairs ?
elaine : no , no . i 'm fine .
leo : jerry , are you listening to this ?
jerry : yeah , uncle leo .
leo : so , so , now the parks commissioner is recommending jeffrey for a citation .
jerry : right . for reducing the pond scum ?
leo : no , for the walking tours .
jerry : oh , yeah . where the people eat the plant life - the edible foliage tour .
leo : that 's exactly right . he knows the whole history of the park . for two hours he 's talking and answering questions . but you want to know something ? whenever
he has a problem with one of these high-powered big shots in the parks department , you know who he calls ?
jerry : mickey mantle ?
elaine : ( helping him worm out of the conversation with leo ) jerry , jerry . did you taste these peas ? these peas are great !
jerry : ( eating a forkful ) these peas are bursting with country-fresh flavor .
elaine : mmm .. phenomenal peas ..
morty : are you ready for dessert ?
jerry : well , actually , we do have to kind of get going .
manya : ( surprised ) you 're going ?
elaine : i do n't really eat dessert . i 'm dieting .
jerry : yeah , i ca n't eat dessert either . the sugar makes my ankles swell up , and i ca n't dance .
manya : ca n't dance ?
helen : he 's kidding , manya .
manya : is that a joke ?
helen : ( canging subject ) so , did you hear claire 's getting married ?
manya : yeah , yeah ..
helen : i hear the fella owns a couple of racehorses . you know , trotters , like at yonkers .
jerry : horses . they 're like big riding dogs .
elaine : what about ponies ? what kind of abnormal animal is that ? and those kids who had their own ponies ..
jerry : i know , i hated those kids . in fact , i hate anyone that ever had a pony when they were growing up .
manya : .. i had a pony .
( the room is dead quiet )
jerry : .. well , i did n't really mean a pony , per se .
manya : ( angry ) when i was a little girl in poland , we all had ponies . my sister had pony , my cousin had pony , .. so , what 's wrong with that ?
jerry : nothing . nothing at all . i was just merely expressting ..
helen : should we have coffee ? who 's having coffee ?
manya : he was a beautiful pony ! and i loved him .
jerry : well , i 'm sure you did . who would n't love a pony ? who would n't love a person that had a pony ?
manya : you ! you said so !
jerry : no , see , we did n't have ponies . i 'm sure at the time in poland , they were very common . they were probably like compact cars ..
manya : that 's it ! i 've had enough ! ( she leaves the room )
isaac : have your coffee , everyone . she 's a little upset . it 's been an emotional day .
( isaac leaves , everyone looks at jerry )
jerry : i did n't know she had a pony . how was i to know she had a pony ? who figures an immigrant 's going to have a pony ? do you know what the odds are on
that ? i mean , in all the pictures i saw of immigrants on boats coming into new york harbor , i never saw one of them sitting on a pony . why would anybody come
hre if they had a pony ? who leaves a country packed with ponies to come to a non-pony country ? it does n't make sense .. am i wrong ?

helen : do n't be rediculous . it was a misunderstanding .
morty : hey , i agree with him . nobody likes a kid with a pony .
jerry : well , if you ever talk to her , tell her i 'm sorry . elaine too . she feels terrible .

jerry : you do n't think that i killed her ?
morty : you know what the flight back 'll cost us ?
jerry : it was just an innocent comment ! i did n't know she had a pony !
morty : maybe we can get an army transport flight . they got a base in sarasota , i think .
jerry : the whole thing ws taking out of context . it was a joke . ( phone rings ) that 's probably uncle leo .

jerry : we do n't understand death . and the proof of this is that we give dead people a pillow . and , uh , i mean , hey , you know . i think if you ca n't stretch out and
get some solid rest at that point , i do n't see how bedding accessories really make the difference . i mean , they got the guy in a suit with a pillow . no is he going to a
meeting , or is he catching forty winks ? i mean , let 's make up our mind where we think they 're going .

jerry : two o ' clock .
elaine : how long does a funeral take ?
jerry : depends on how nice the person was . but you got ta figure , even oswald took forty-five minutes .
elaine : so you cna't do both ?
jerry : you know , if the situation were reversed and manya had some mah-jongg championship or something , i would n't expect her to go to my funeral . i would
understand .
elaine : how can you even consider not going ?
george : you know , i 've been thinking .. i can not envision any circumstances in which i 'll ever have the opportunity to have sex again . how 's it gon na happen ? i
just do n't see how it could occur .
elaine : you know , funerals always make me think about my own mortality and how i 'm actually going to die someday . me , dead . imagine that .
george : they always make me take stock of my life and how i 've pretty much wasted all of it , and how i plan to continue wasting it .
jerry : i know , and then you say to yourself , `` from this moment on , i 'm not going to waste any more of it . '' but then you go , `` how ? what can i do that 's not
wasting it ? ''
elaine : is this a waste of time ? what should we be doing ? ca n't you hae coffee with people ?
george : you know , i ca n't believe you 're even considering not playing . we need you . you 're hitting everything .
elaine : he has to go . he may have killed her .

elaine : oh , yeah , but i did n't say i hated anyone who had one .
george : ( to jerry ) who 's going to play left field ?
jerry : bender .
george : bender ? he ca n't play left . he stinks . i just do n't see what purpose is it going to serve your going ? i mean , you think dead peole care who 's at the
funeral ? they do n't even know they 're having a funeral . it 's not like she 's hanging out in the back going , `` i ca n't believe jerry did n't show up . ''
elaine : maybe she 's there in spirit . how about that ?
george : if you 're a spirit , and you can travel to other dimensions and galaxies , and find out the mysteries of the universe , you think she 's going to want to hang
around drexler 's funeral home on ocean parkway ?
elaine : george , i met this woman ! she is not traveling to any other dimensions .
george : you know how easy it is for dead people to travel ? it 's not like getting on a bus . one second . it 's all mental .

boots . that 's it . '' we should come up for an outfit for earth . an earth outfit . we should vote on it . candidates propose different outfits , no speeches . they walk out ,

alton : drivel .
george : maybe some parts .
alton : what parts ?
george : the drivel parts .. oh my gosh , i just realized - i have to make a phone call . i can believe .. would you .. ( gets up , and leaves )
( scene cuts to the hotel bathroom )
george : thank you for leaving me alone with him !
jerry : that was brutal . i ca n't go back out there .
george : well , let 's just leave .
jerry : elaine 'll kill me .
george : where is she ?
jerry : she 's got ta be here soon .
george : how could she leave us alone with this lunatic ? ten more minutes , and that 's it ! i 'm leaving . i have to tell you , this guy scares me .
jerry : the waiter was trembling .
george : if she does n't show up , we ca n't possibly have dinner with him alone .
jerry : how are we gon na get out of it ?
george : we 'll say we 're frightened and we have to go home .
jerry : yeah , that 's good . he 'd clunk our heads together like moe .
george : i do n't know . just start scratching . tell him you have the crabs . he was in the military . he 'll understand that .
( scene ends )
[ setting : night club ]
jerry : all fathers are intimidating . they 're intimidating because they are fathers . once a man has children , for the rest of his life , his attitude is , `` to hell with the
world , i can make my own people . i 'll eat whatever i want . i 'll wear whatever i want , and i 'll create whoever i want . ''
( scene ends )
[ setting : hotel lobby ]
( jerry and george come back from the bathroom )
alton : who 'd you call ?
george : ( caught off guard ) my uncle is having an operation . i just wanted to see how he was .
alton : what kind of operation ?
george : bone marrow .
( manager approaches )
manager : mister benes ?
alton : yes ?
manager : a message for you . ( hands him a message )
alton : from elaine . she got tied up . she 'll be here in thirty minutes . ( jerry and george freeze )
( scene ends )
[ setting : hotel lobby ]
alton : yeah , they should 've taken care of castro when they had the chance . like we did in guatamala in 'fifty-three .
jerry : ( adding ) well , guatamala .
george : sure , guatamala .
alton : ( gets up ) alright , you boys get yourselves together . we 'll head up to the restaurant . i 'll leave a note for elaine . i 'm going to the bathroom . ( leaves )
george : come on , let 's go !
jerry : what about elaine ?
george : to hell with elaine !
jerry : she 'll be furious .
george : we 're dying here !
( elaine enters )
jerry : that 's her ! she 's here !
elaine : i 'm sorry . i 'm so sorry . where is dad ?
george : ( mocking alton 's voice ) he 's in the bathroom .
jerry : where have you been ? !
elaine : kramer , that .. kramer ! i 'm just about to leave , he calls me up . he begs me to sit in his car for two minutes , so he can pick up these birds ..
jerry : oh , you did n't ..
elaine : well , he said he 'd drive me here right after . so , i am sitting in his car twenty minutes ! he does n't come down . i am freezing . then a cop comes by , tells me
to get out of the car . he 's a city marshal . he 's towing the car away . kramer owes thousands of dollars in back tickets . he was going to tow it with me in the car !
so , they tow the car . now , i am standing outside , and i am freezing , but i can not leave because i have to tell him what happened to the car .. so , finally , he finally
comes down with his giant cage filled with doves . he said he was getting special instructions , that each dove has a different diet . so , we 're wandering around trying
to get a cab , when two of these doves fly out ! now we 're running down the street after these doves . i almost got hit by a bus . ( sits down , takes a deep breath ) .. so
how 's everything going over here ?
jerry : ( after hearing elaine 's story , his is .. ) great .
george : could n't be better .
elaine : good . 'cause dad can make some people a little uncomfortable .
jerry : oh , no , no .
george : get outta here ..
elaine : man , kramer ! i could kill him .
jerry : i ca n't believe it . you know better than to get involved with kramer .
elaine : he said he 'd give me a lift .
jerry : ah , the lift . like the lure of the siren 's song . never what it seems to be , yet who among us can resist ?
george : where do you come up with this stuff ?
alton : ( returns ) well , look who 's here .
elaine : oh , hi , dad .
alton : ( kisses elaine ) hello , dear . who 's the lipstick for ?
elaine : no one .
alton : .. how 's your mother ?
elaine : fine .
alton : how about you ? are you working ?
elaine : yeah , i 'm reading manuscripts for pendant publishing . i told you ten times .
alton : pendant , those bastards .. alright , boys . we 'll go to that pakistani restaurant on 46th street . you 're not afraid of a little spice , are you ?
( they all head for the door . jerry and george trail behind a little )
george : `` master of the house , doling out the charm . ready with a handshake and an open .. ''
alton : pipe down , chorus boy .
( alton glares , george gets embarrassed )
elaine : ohh .. it 's snowing . it 's beautiful .
jerry : ( to george ) snow .. snow , that ca n't be good for suede , can it ?
george : i would n't think so .
jerry : what should i do ? ( to alton ) we 're taking a cab , are n't we ?
alton : cab ? it 's only five blocks .
george : ( to jerry ) why do n't you just turn it inside out ?
jerry : inside out ! great .
( jery turns his jacket inside out , showing of the pink striped insides . alton stops him before jerry can leave the hotel )
alton : wait a minute . what the hell do you call this ?
jerry : oh , i turned my jacket inside out .
alton : well , you look like a damn fool !
jerry : ( like a child ) well , it 's a new suede jacket . it might get ruined .
alton : well , you 're not going to walk down the street with my and my daughter dressed like that ! that 's for damn sure !
( jerry looks at george )
george : it 's only a few blocks .
( scene ends )
[ setting : jerry 's apartment ]
( jerry 's heading out , the intercom buzzes )
jerry : ( into intercom ) elaine ?
elaine : yeah .
jerry : come on up .
( enter kramer )
kramer : hey .
jerry : hey .
kramer : i 've got ta feed the birds .
jerry : so ? ..
kramer : you got any of those mini ritzes ?
( jerry reaches up , and pulls out some mini ritzes )
jerry : i ca n't believe i do .
kramer : yeah ! .. well , are you going out ?
jerry : yeah .
kramer : hey , where 's your new jacket ? ( jerry points to the jacket hanging in the bathroom . it 's ruined , and unwearable ) what ? ( kramer enters the bathroom ,
he 's shocked at the sight of the jacket ) ohhh . what did you do to it ?
jerry : i was out in the snow last night .
kramer : do n't youk now what that does to suede ?
jerry : i have an idea . ( elaine enters ) we can make the nine-thirty at cinema iii .
elaine : okay .. ( to kramer ) hello . ( to jerry ) listen , thanks again for coming last night . dad said he had a great time .
jerry : is he still in town ?
elaine : no , he 's driving back to maryland tonight .
kramer : ( talking about the ruined jacket ) so , uh .. what are you gon na do with that one now ?
jerry : i do n't know .
kramer : well ? ..
elaine : ( to jerry ) i did n't want to tell you this , but usually he hates everyone .
jerry : really ?
kramer : you gon na throw this out ?
jerry : well , i ca n't wear it .
elaine : ( to jerry ) yeah , he like you though . said you reminded him of somebody he knew in korea .
kramer : well , if you 're just gon na throw it out , you know , i could take it .
jerry : yeah , go ahead , take it .
elaine : dad thinks george is gay .
jerry : oh , because of all that singing ?
elaine : no , he pretty much thinks everyone is gay .
( kramer returns from the bathroom wearing the ruined suede jacket )
kramer : hey , see , i like it like this .
elaine : ( pointing at the jacket kramer 's wearing ) isnt ' that .. ? ( jerry nods ) oh , is this fromt he snow last night ? ( jerry nods again ) ugh .. you know what you
should 've done ? you should 've turned it inside out .
jerry : i 'll try and remember that .
kramer : ( talking about the leather jacket from the start of the show ) boy , it 's too bad you gave me this one too .
jerry : ( sarcastic ) yeah , too bad .
kramer : i 'm gon na have to do something about this lining .
( kramer exits , scene ends )
[ setting : alton benes ' car ]
( alton is driving home , then all the sudden , he starts to sing )
alton : `` master of the house doling out the charm , ready with a handshake and an open palm .. ''
( scene ends )
[ setting : night club ]
jerry : i had a leather jacket that got ruined . now , why does moisture ruin leather ? i do n't get this . are n't cows ouside most of the time ? i do n't understand it .
when it 's raining do cows go up to the farmhouse , `` let us in , we 're all wearing leather .. open the door ! we 're gon na ruin the whole outfit here .. '' `` is it suede ? '' `` i am
suede , the whole thing is suede , i ca n't have this cleaned . it 's all i got ! ''
jerry 's opening monologue : the bad thing about television is that everybody you see on television is
doing something better than what you 're doing . did you ever see anybody on tv
like just sliding off the front of the sofa with potato chip crumbs on their
face ? some people have a little too much fun on television : the soda
commercial people - where do they summon this enthusiasm ? have you seen them ?
`` we have soda , we have soda , we have soda '' , jumping , laughing , flying through
the air - it 's a can of soda . have you ever been standing there and you 're
watching tv and you 're drinking the exact same product that they 're advertising
right there on tv , and it 's like , you know , they 're spiking volleyballs ,
jetskiing , girls in bikinis and i 'm standing there - `` maybe i 'm putting too much
ice in mine . ''

monk 's diner , day . george and jerry enter . george is excited :
george : so then , as we were leaving , we were just kind of standing there ,
and she was sort of smiling at me , and i was n't sure if she wanted me to ask her
out , because when women smile at me i do n't know what it means . sometimes i
interpret it like they 're psychotic or something and i do n't know if i 'm
supposed to smile back , i do n't know what to do . so i just stood there like -
remember how quayle looked when benson gave him that kennedy line ? - that 's what
i looked like .
jerry : so you did n't ask ?
george : no , i froze .
jerry : ( points to counter ) counter .

george : oh yeah . so wait , wait . a half-hour later i 'm back in the office ,
i tell lloyd the whole story . he says `` so why do n't you call her '' . i says `` i
ca n't . '' i could n't , i could n't do it right then . for me to ask a woman out i
got ta get into a mental state like the karate guys before they break the bricks .
so lloyd calls me a wuss .
jerry : he said wuss ?
george : yeah . anyway , he shamed me into it .
jerry : so you called . ( they sit at counter )
george : right . and , and to cover my nervousness i started eating an apple ,
because i think if they hear you chewing on the other end of the phone , it
makes you sound casual .
jerry : yeah , like a farm boy .
george : right . so i call her up , i tell her it 's me , she gives me an
enthusiastic 'hi ! '
jerry : wow . enthusiastic 'hi ! ' , that 's beautiful .
george : oh , i do n't get the enthusiastic 'hi ! ' , i 'm outta there .
jerry : alright , so you 're chewing your apple , you got your enthusiastic
'hi ! ' go ahead .
george : so , we 're talking , and i do n't like to go too long before i ask them
out , i wan na get it over with right away , so i just blurt out `` what are you
doing saturday night ? ''
jerry : and ?
george : she bought .
jerry : great day in the morning .
george : then i got off the phone right away .
jerry : sure , it 's like robbing a bank : you do n't loiter around in front of
the teller holding that big bag of money . you come in , you hit and get out .
george : it 's amazing : we , we both have dates on the same night . i ca n't
remember the last time that happened .

george 's car , parked outside apartment building , night . george and his date
carol :
george : i ca n't stand doing laundry . that 's why i have forty pairs of
underwear .
carol : you do not .
george : absolutely . because instead of doing a wash , i just keep buying
underwear . my goal is to have over three hundred and sixty pair . that way , i
only have to do wash once a year .
( they both laugh )

jerry 's car , also parked outside an apartment building . jerry and his
girlfriend donna :
jerry : ( in awful scots/irish accent ) come on , try it . let me hear you try
a scottish accent .
donna : that 's irish .
jerry : irish , scottish , what 's the difference , lassie ?
( donna laughs )

back to george and carol :
donna : so , er , thanks for dinner . it was great .
george : yeah . we should do this again .
donna : would you like to come upstairs for some coffee ?
george : oh , no , thanks . i ca n't drink coffee late at night , it keeps me up .
donna : ( looks disappointed ) so , um , ok .
george : ok .
donna : goodnight .
george : yeah , take it easy .
( donna leaves car . george realizes what he has done and bashes his
forehead in disgust )

back to jerry and donna :
donna : thanks again for the movie .
jerry : you 're welcome .
donna : i 'd invite you up , but the place is being painted .
jerry : oh , that 's ok .
donna : unless you want to go to your place .
jerry : ok , but there 's no cake or anything , if that 's what you 're looking
for .

back to george , driving , looking frustrated :
george : take it easy , huh , take it easy .

jerry 's apartment . jerry and donna sit on the sofa :
jerry : i think if one 's going to kill oneself , the least you could do is
leave a note - it 's common courtesy . i do n't know , that 's just the way i was
brought up .
donna : values are very important .
jerry : oh , so important . so what are you doing thursday night - you wan na
have dinner ?
donna : thursday 's great . ( moves closer )
jerry : ( looks at his pants ) tan pants . why do i buy tan pants , donna ? i
do n't feel comfortable in them .
donna : are those cotton dockers ?
jerry : oh , i ca n't begin to tell you how much i hate that commercial .
donna : really ? i like that commercial . ( jerry pauses )
jerry : you like that commercial ?
donna : yeah , it 's clever .
jerry : now wait a second , you mean the one where the guys are all standing
around , supposedly being very casual and witty ?
donna : yeah , that 's the one .
jerry : what could you possibly like about that ?
donna : i do n't know , i like the guys .
jerry : yeah , they 're so funny and so comfortable with each other , and i
could be comfortable too , if i had pants like that . i could sit on a porch and
wrestle around , and maybe even be part of a real bull session .
donna : hey , i know guys like that . to me the dialogue rings true .
jerry : ( shrugs . pause ) even if the dialogue did ring true . even if
somehow somewhere men actually talk like that , what does that have to do with
the pants ? does n't that bother you ?
donna : ( increasingly annoyed ) that 's the idea . that 's what 's clever about
it , that they 're not talking about the pants .
jerry : but they 're talking about nothing .
donna : that 's the point .
jerry : i know the point .
donna : no one is telling you to like it .
jerry : i mean , all those quick shots of the pants , just pants , pants ,
pants , pants , pants , pants , pants . what is that supposed to be ?
( donna sighs , leans away from jerry , looks at watch )

jerry monologue :
what 's brutal about the date is the scrutiny that you put each other
through . because whenever you think about this person in terms of the future ,
you have to magnify everything about them . you know , like the guy 'll be like
' i do n't think her eyebrows are even . could i look at uneven eyebrows for the
rest of my life ? ' and of course the woman 's looking at the guy , thinking 'what
is he looking at ? do i want somebody looking at me like this for the rest of my
life ? '

jerry 's apartment , day . jerry and elaine :
jerry : i 'm supposed to see her again on thursday , but can i go out with
someone who actually likes this commercial ?
elaine : i once broke up with a guy because he did n't keep his bathroom clean
enough .
jerry : no kidding . did you tell him that was the reason ?
elaine : oh yeah , i told him all the time . you would not have believed his
tub : germs were building a town in there - they were constructing offices .
houses near the drain were going for $ 150,000 .
( george enters , looking miserable , holding a brown paper bag )
elaine : hi .
( george produces pepto-bismol bottle and box of bicarb from bag , places
them on counter )
jerry : you 're still thinking about this ?
george : ( while preparing bicarb ) she invites me up at twelve o clock at
night , for coffee . and i do n't go up . `` no thank you , i do n't want coffee , it
keeps me up . too late for me to drink coffee . '' i said this to her . people
this stupid should n't be allowed to live . i ca n't imagine what she must think
of me .
jerry : she thinks you 're a guy that does n't like coffee .
george : she invited me up . coffee 's not coffee , coffee is sex .
elaine : maybe coffee was coffee .
george : coffee 's coffee in the morning , it 's not coffee at twelve o clock at
night .
elaine : well some people drink coffee that late .
george : yeah , people who work at norad , who 're on twenty-four hour missile
watch . everything was going along so great : she was laughing , i was funny . i
kept saying to myself `` keep it up , do n't blow it , you 're doing great . ''
elaine : it 's all in your head . all she knows is she had a good time . i
think you should call her .
george : i ca n't call her now , it 's too soon . i 'm planning a wednesday call .
elaine : oh , why ? i love it when guys call me the next day .
george : of course you do , but you 're imagining a guy you like , not a guy who
goes ( in stupid voice ) `` oh no , i do n't drink coffee late at night . '' if i call
her now , she 's gon na think i 'm too needy .
women do n't wan na see need . they want a take-charge guy - a colonel , a
kaiser , a tsar .
elaine : all she 'll think is that you like her .
george : yes , she wants me to like her , if she likes me , but she does n't like
me !
elaine : i do n't know what your parents did to you .
( kramer enters , points at jerry )
kramer : hey , i just thought of a really funny thing for your act . alright ,
you 're up there , you 're on the stage and you go `` hey , you ever notice how cars
here in new york , they never get out of the way of ambulances anymore .
someone 's in a life-and-death situation , and we 're thinking 'well , sorry buddy ,
you should 've thought of that when you were eating cheese omelettes and sauages
for breakfast every morning for the last thirty years . ' '' so you gon na use it ?
jerry : i do n't think so .
kramer : it 's funny .
elaine : it is funny .
kramer : that 's as good as anything you do .
george : alright , i got ta make a call . everybody out , come on .
jerry : why do we have to leave ?
george : because i ca n't call a woman with other people in the room . come
on , let 's go .
elaine : oh , see , this is the problem .
jerry : you 're kicking me out of my house ?
george : yes .
elaine : do n't forget .
george : oh jerry , do you have any apples ?
jerry : do n't do the apples . that 's enough already with the apples .
( elaine , kramer and jerry leave . george removes jacket , dials phone )
phone : hi , it 's carol , i 'll get back to you . ( beep )
george : uhm , hi , it 's george , george costanza , remember me ? the guy that
did n't come up for coffee .
you see , i did n't realise that coffee did n't really mean ... well ,
whatever . anyway , it was fun . it was , erm , it was fun , so , oh boy , uhm , so ,
you call me back . if you want , it 's up to you , you know , whatever you wan na do .
either way . the ball 's in your court . so , er , take it easy .
( hangs up . jerry enters )
jerry : i 'm just gon na get my jacket , i 'll meet you downstairs . what 's the
matter , did you call ?
( elaine enters )
george : got her machine . i 'm dead , i 'm a dead man . that 's it . i 'm dead ,
i 'm a dead man . dead man .
jerry : what did you say ?
george : i do n't know what the hell i said . i gave her an ultimatum and
there 's nothing i can do . it 's a machine . the little light is blinking right
now : 'come and listen to the idiot . hey everybody , the idiot 's on ! '
jerry : after one date you try and improvise on her machine ?
george : now i 'm in the worst position of all .
elaine : y'know , my brother-in-law once left a message on this guy 's machine ,
and he blurted out some business information he was n't supposed to , and it would
have cost him $ 15,000 , so he waited outside the guy 's house and when the guy
came home he went upstairs with him and he switched the tape .
george : he did that ?
elaine : yeah .
george : somebody did that ?
jerry : she 'll call you back . you 're overreacting .

jerry 's apartment . jerry and donna :
jerry : not once .
donna : never ?
jerry : i have never seen one episode of ' i love lucy ' in my life ever .
donna : that 's amazing .
jerry : thank you .
donna : is there anything else about you i should know ?
jerry : yes , i 'm lactose intolerant .
donna : really ?
jerry : i have no patience for lactose . and i wo n't stand for it . uhm ,
i 'll be right back . ( goes to bathroom )
( george enters )
george : wait till you hear this ( sees donna ) . whoa , ah , i 'm sorry , i
did n't , i had no idea . ( goes to leave )
donna : wait , wait . he 's in the bathroom .
george : i just wanted to talk to him for a minute , but i 'll come back .
donna : you do n't have to leave .
george : you sure ?
donna : yes .
george : ok .
donna : i 'm donna .
george : donna . oh , you 're the one that likes that commercial !
donna : he told you about that .
george : no , he , he did n't actually tell me that , uh , we were talking about
that commercial , in fact i think i brought it up because i like that commercial .
no , he , he would never tell me anything like that . he never discusses anything .
he 's , he 's like a clam . you 're not gon na mention this , to him .. ( jerry re-
enters )
donna : ( to jerry ) so you go around telling your friends i 'm not hip
because i like that commercial .
jerry : what ? ( to george ) what did , what did you say ?
george : say ? what ? nothing , i ..
donna : you told him how i like the commercial .
jerry : well , so what if i said that ?
donna : well , so , you did n't have to tell your friends .
jerry : no , i had to tell my friends , my friends did n't have to tell you .
george : ( to donna ) why did you have to get me in trouble ?
donna : i do n't like you talking about me with your friends behind my back .
george : boy oh boy .
jerry : i said i could n't believe you liked that commercial . so what ?
donna : i asked some friends of mine this week , and all of them liked the
commercial .
jerry : boy , i bet you got a regular algonquin round table there .
( kramer enters )
k hey .
jerry : oh , kramer , this is donna .
k oh . cotton dockers !
george : hello ! alright , we should be going . come on . ( grabs kramer )
k what ? where are we going ?
george : come on !
donna : do n't bother , i 'm leaving .
jerry : donna , really , you 're making too much of this .
k one hundred percent cotton dockers , if they 're not dockers , they 're just
pants !
jerry : please , donna .
donna : i do n't wan na hear it . ( leaves )
george : i ca n't believe i said that . you know me , i 'm a vault .
jerry : do n't worry about it , it was n't working anyway .
k what happened there ?
jerry : i 'll tell you later .
george : you are not gon na believe what 's going on with this woman .


monk 's diner . george and jerry sat in booth :
george : ok , so you remember i made the initial call sunday , she does n't call
back . i call again monday , i leave another message . i call tuesday , i get the
machine again : `` i know you 're there , i do n't know what your story is . ''
yesterday , i 'm a volcano - i try one more call , the machine comes on , and fly
like mussolini from the balcony- `` where the hell do you get the nerve ? you
invite me up for coffee and then you do n't call me back for four days ? i do n't
like coffee , i do n't have to come up . i 'd like to get one more shot at the
coffee just so i could spit it in your face . ''
jerry : you said that ?
george : i lost it .
jerry : i ca n't blame you . i ca n't believe she never called you back .
george : she did . today .
jerry : what ?
george : she called my office . she said she 's been in the hamptons since
sunday . she did n't know if i was trying to get in touch with her . her machine
broke , and she 's been using her old machine and she does n't have the beeper for
it .
jerry : so she did n't get the messages .
george : exactly , but they 're on there waiting . she said she ca n't wait to
see me , we 're having dinner tonight . she 's supposed to call me as soon as she
gets home .
jerry : but what about the messages ?
( george produces cassette tape from pocket )
jerry : elaine 's thing ? how you gon na get in ?
george : i 'll meet her outside the building .
jerry : but you know as soon as she gets in the apartment she 's going right
for that machine .
george : or she goes for the bathroom . that 's my only chance . who am i
kidding ? i ca n't do this , i ca n't do this . i do n't even know how to work those
stupid machines .
jerry : there 's nothing to it . you lift the lid , it comes right out .
george : you do it for me .
jerry : what ?
george : come on , it 'll be so much easier .
jerry : how you gon na get me up there ?

( carol arrives )
george : hey ! what are you doing here ? i thought i was supposed to call you

george : i , i could n't wait . i was too anxious to see you .
carol : oh , that 's so sweet .
george : oh , this is my friend , jerry seinfeld . i just bumped into him
around the corner . is n't that a coincidence ? the funny thing is , i see him all
the time .
jerry : all the time .
carol : it 's nice to meet you .
jerry : hi .
carol : so , i 'm starving . where are we gon na eat ?
george : you know , we could go uptown , and that way we could give jerry a
ride home .
carol : ok. let 's go , i 'm ready , where 'd you park ?
george : do n't you wan na go upstairs first ?
carol : no , what for ? i 'll just give my bag to the doorman .
jerry : you know , i really need to use the bathroom .
carol : oh well there 's a bathroom in the coffee shop just next door .
george : yes , yes , but er , i have to make a call , so ...
carol : well they have a phone .
( george takes carol to one side )
george : i know jerry . he has this phobia about public toilets . i think we
really should go upstairs .
carol : ( aloud ) you know , i think i will go upstairs . i can check my
machine .
george : right , right .
( they enter building )

inside carol 's apartment . carol , jerry and george enter :
carol : the bathroom 's on the hall to the right .
jerry : er , you know , why do n't you go first , you just had a long trip .
carol : no , i 'm fine .
jerry : uhmmm , you know , it 's the damnedest thing , it went away .
carol : oh that 's weird .
george : no , no that can happen . i 've , er , i 've read about that in medical
journals . it 's a freak thing , but ...
carol : well , let me just check my messages , and we 'll go .
george : uh , carol , can i talk to you for a second ? right now .
carol : sure .
george : please , this is very , very important . ( leads her to other room )
( jerry goes over to machine to switch tape )
george : ( shouts from other room ) uhh , tippy toe ! tippy toe ! lemon tree !
( carol reappears followed by george )
carol : ( to jerry ) now i know who you are . you 're a comedian . i 've seen
you , it 's driving me crazy .
jerry : right . i am .
george : carol , that 's so rude . please , i 'm serious , just for a moment , if
you would n't mind , and then we 'll talk to jerry .
( george leads carol back out , jerry switches tapes )
jerry : ( shouts ) hey you two . i 'm ready to go .
( george and carol return )
carol : that 's what you had to tell me ? your father wears sneakers in the
pool ?
george : ( to jerry ) do n't you find that strange ?
jerry : yes .
carol : well , i 'll just check my machine and we 'll go . no , nothing here ,
let 's go . oh , i forgot to tell you . after i talked to you today my neighbour
called me and played my messages to me over the phone .
george : oh , uhhh ...
carol : yours were hilarious , we were both cracking up . i just love jokes
like that .
( all three leave )

jerry 's closing monologue :
i love my phone machine . i wish i was a phone machine . i wish if i saw
somebody on the street i did n't want to talk to i could go `` excuse me , i 'm not
in right now . if you could just leave a message , i could walk away . '' i also
have a cordless phone , but i do n't like that as much , because you ca n't slam
down a cordless phone . you get mad at somebody on a real phone - `` you ca n't
talk to me like that ! '' bang ! you know . you get mad at somebody on a cordless
phone - `` you ca n't talk to me like that ! '' ( mimes fiddly button-pressing ) `` i
told him ! ''
[ setting : night club ]
jerry : well , i painted my apartment again . i 've been living in this apartment for years and years , and every time i paint it , it kinda gets me down . i look around ,
and i think , well , it 's a little bit smaller now . you know , i realize it 's just the thickness of the paint , but i 'm aware of it . it keeps coming in and coming in . everytime i
paint it , it 's closer and closer . i do n't even know where the wall outlets are anymore . i just look for like a lump with two slots in it . kinda looks like a pig is trying to
push his way through from the other side . that 's where i plug in .. my idea of the perfect living room would be the bridge on the starship enterprise . you know what
i mean ? big chair , nice screen , remote control .. that 's why star trek really was the ultimate male fantasy . just hurling through space in your living room , watching
tv . that 's why all the aliens were always dropping in , because kirk was the only one that had a big screen . they came over friday night , klingon boxing .. got ta be
there .

( jerry and elaine are looking at kramer with their arms folded . his hair is slicked down )
jerry : what did you do ?
kramer : mousse . i moussed up .
elaine : i guess it was just a matter of time .
kramer : you know , i should 've done this years ago . i mean , i feel like i had two lives . my pre-mousse and now , i begin my post-mousse . hey , tell me the truth ,
have you ever seen a better looking guy ?
jerry : oh , look , its so subjective .
elaine : i do n't mean to interrupt or anything , but on sunday , my friend is having a brunch for the new york marathon .
kramer : oh , i keep forgetting to enter that .
elaine : she lives right above first avenue , and says she has a perfect view of the race . and she said i can invite some friends .
jerry : maybe .
( a loud argument erupts in the hallway between harold and manny , the building supervisors )
harold : no , i 'm not going up there . ( manny screams out something in spanish )
jerry : harold and manny .
harold : i 'm not going . ( manny says something in spanish , jerry goes out into the hall )
jerry : boys , boys .
harold : oh , jerry .
jerry : i slid the rent under your door , harold . did you get it ?
harold : yeah , yeah .. ( joking ) hey , jerry , would you like anything from mrs. hudwalker 's apartment ? ( manny starts yelling at harold in spanish ) i was only
joking . ( to jerry ) he thinks i 'm going to give you mrs. hudwalker 's things . ( manny starts talking in spanish ) we have to go up there now and clean the apartment .
it 's a good thing her rent was overdue . she 'd be rotting up there for a month .
jerry : she died ? .. mrs. hudwalker died ?
harold : ninety-four years old . i found her yesterday . she did n't have a wig on . it was horrifying .
manny : harold , ( in spanish ) come on , hurry up !
harold : ( to manny ) what 's the matter with you ? ! i 'm talking . so , jerry , you know anyone who needs an apartment ?
jerry : are you kidding ? you know my friend elaine ?
harold : oh yeah , i like her . she always says `` hello '' to me .
jerry : it 's not promised to anybody ? 'cause she would take it in a second .
harold : well , manny wanted it for his brother , but he got deported . ( manny starts protesting in spanish ) what 's the difference ? it 's true .
jerry : so , it 's okay ? i could just tell her she can have it ?
harold : sure , sure . she 's getting a bargain , too . it 's only four hundred dollars a month . ( manny yells in spanish ) okay .. ( manny keeps talking in spanish ) okay .
( jerry goes back to his apartment , passing kramer on the way )
kramer : ( talking about his hair ) hey , harold , what do you think ?
harold : manny , look , kramer put mousse in his hair .
manny : ( in spanish ) it looks worse .
kramer : ( not knowing what manny said ) thanks .
( jerry enters his apartment )
elaine : what was that all about ?
jerry : oh , nothing important .
elaine : what 's going on ? what is that look ?
jerry : what look ? nothing .
elaine : something 's going on here .
jerry : i do n't know if you should sit for this or not . sitting is good if you faint , but standing is good for jumping up and down .. i ca n't decide .
elaine : jumping up and down ? what are you talking about ? c'mon . cough it up .
jerry : oh , elaine . you know the way i am - rarely ever thinking of myself . my only concern is the welfare and happiness of those close to me . sure , it hurts
sometimes - to give , and give , and give ..
elaine : would you please ?
jerry : what would you say if i told you that ..
elaine : told me what ? !
jerry : .. i got you an apartment in this building .
elaine : ( dumbfounded ) no .
jerry : yes .
elaine : no .
jerry : yes .
elaine : you did n't .
jerry : i did .
elaine : you got me an apartment in the building ? !
jerry : i got you an apartment in the building .
elaine : how did you ..
jerry : remember mrs. hudwalker ? the ninety-four-year-old woman who lived above me ?
elaine : no .
jerry : she died .
elaine : ( thrilled ) she died ? !
jerry : she died .
elaine : she died !
jerry : and the rent 's only four hundred dollars a month !
elaine : get out ! ( pushes jerry , he stumbles back ) four hundred a month ? only four hundred a month ? !
jerry : four hundred a month .
elaine : and i 'll be right upstairs ?
jerry : right upstairs .
elaine : right above you ?
jerry : right above me .
elaine : oh , we 're neighbors . i 'll be here all the time !

elaine : we can exchange keys so we can come in and out . oh , this is going to be great !
jerry : .. all the time ..

[ setting : night club ]
jerry : the problem with talking is that nobody stops you from saying the wrong thing . i think life would be a lot better if it was like you 're always making a movie .
you mess up , somebody just walks on the set , and stops the whole shot . you know what i mean ? think of the things you wish you could take back . you 're out
somewhere with people , `` gee , you look pregnant .. are ya ? '' `` cut , cut , cut , cut , cut , that 's not gon na work at all . walk out the door , and come back in . let 's take

george : what ? what did you do ?
jerry : i could tell you what i did , but you would n't believe it . it 's not believable .
george : what did you do ?
jerry : how could i have done that ?
george : done what ?
jerry : i told elaine about an apartment opening up in my building . she 's going to move in .
george : elaine 's moving into your building ?
jerry : yes . right above me .
george : right above you ?
jerry : yes .
george : you 're gon na be neighbors .
jerry : i know . neighbors .
george : she 's right above you ?
jerry : right above me .
george : how could you do that ?
jerry : 'cause i 'm an idiot ! you may think you 're an idiot , but with all due respect - i 'm a much bigger idiot than you are .
george : do n't insult me , my friend . remember who you 're talking to . no one 's a bigger idiot than me .
jerry : did you ever ask an ex-girlfriend to move into your building ?
george : did you ever go to a singles weekend in the poconos ?
jerry : she 's right in my building ! right above me ! every time i come in the building , i 'm gon na have to sneak around like a cat burglar .
george : you 're doomed . you 're gon na have to have all your sex at women 's apartments . it 'll be like a permanent road trip . forget about the home bed
advantage .
jerry : but i need the home bed advantage !
george : of course , we all do .
jerry : ( gesturing to the coffee shop ) come in for two minutes and sit with me .
george : i was just in there . it 's embarrassing .
jerry : oh , who 's gon na know ?
george : they saw me walk out .
jerry : two minutes .
( scene cuts to jerry and george in the coffee shop )
jerry : my censoring system broke down . you know that little guy in your head who watches everything you say ? makes sure you do n't make a mistake ? he went
for a cup of coffee , and in that second - ruined my life .
george : my censor quit two years ago . he checked into a clinic . emotionally exhausted .
jerry : .. so , is there any way out of this elaine thing ?
george : tough .
jerry : you know , the water pressure 's terrible in my building .. and she loves a good shower .
george : i do n't think anyone 's turned down an apartment because of a weak shower spray .
jerry : if they were fanatic about showers , they might .
george : for that rent , she 'd take a bath in the toilet tank if she had to ..
jerry : look at that woman feeding her baby greasy , disgusting , coffee shop corned beef hash . is n't that child abuse ?
george : i 'd like to have a kid . of course , you have to have a date first .. remember my friend , adam , from detroit ?
jerry : yeah , the guy with the flat head ?
george : he 's a cube .. anyway , he got married six months ago . he told me ever since he 's been wearing a wedding band , women have been coming on to him
everywhere he goes .
jerry : yeah , i 've heard that about wedding bands .
george : ( joking ) i wonder if that 's really true .
jerry : that would be an interesting sociological experiment . you know , kramer has his father 's band . he 'd loan it to you .

[ setting : apartment buliding hallway ]
( george is trying on a wedding band )
george : thanks a lot . i '' ll give it back to you in a week .
kramer : you know , i do n't even know why you 're fooling around with this ring . i 've been telling you , get yourself some plugs , or a piece .
george : i 'm not doing that .
kramer : oh , man . you know , you 're crazy . you 're a good looking guy . what do you want to walk around like that for ?
george : no , i 'll put half a can of mousse in my head like you .
( manny and harold are arguing again from down the hall )
harold : i told you i do n't like these sponges , they 're too small ! i want a big sponge ! ( manny yells ) you ca n't pick up anything with these ! there 's no absorption !
( manny yells in spanish , jerry exits his apartment )
jerry : boys , boys .
harold : hi , jerry .
harold : hello , jerry . ( says something in spanish to harold )
harold : okay .. your friend ca n't have the apartment , jerry .
jerry : what ?
harold : because somebody offered manny five thousand dollars for the apartment . i do n't want to do it . manny wants to do it . ( manny yells ) because it 's true !
why should n't i tell him ?
jerry : hey , hey . i understand . you 're businessmen . ( manny talks in spanish )
harold : oh , now , he says that if your friend has five thousand dollars , we 'll give it to her .
jerry : well , that 's a lot of money . but , if that 's the way it 's got ta be , that 's the way it 's got ta be . ( goes back to his apartment ) you know , i used to think that the
universe is a random , chaotic , sequence of meaningless events , but i see now that there is reason and purpose to all things .
george : what happened to you ?
jerry : religion , my friend , that 's what happened to me . because , i have just been informed that it 's going to cost elaine the sum of five thousand dollars to get the
apartment upstairs .
george : five thousand dollars ? she does n't have five thousand dollars !
jerry : of course she does n't have five thousand dollars !
george : so , she ca n't get the apartment .
jerry : ca n't get it .
george : so , she does n't move in .
jerry : no move . so , you see , it 's all part of a divine plan .
george : and how does the baldness fit into that plan ?
( the intercom buzzes )
jerry : ( into the intercom ) elaine ?
elaine : yeah .
jerry : ( unlocks the main door . to george ) alright , this is going to require some great acting now . i have to pretend i 'm disappointed . you 're going to really see
me being a phony , now . i hope you can take this .. maybe you should go in the other room .
george : are you kidding ? ! i lie ever second of the day . my whole life is a sham !
jerry : 'cause you know , i love elaine .
george : of course you do .
jerry : but you know .. not in the building . really , i feel terrible about this . my intentions were good . what can i do ? tell me ..
( enter elaine ) elaine : ( to someone in the hallway ) no , i 'll be seeing you . ( starts to sing ) `` good morning , good morning .. '' have you ever gotten up in the morning
and felt it 's great to be alive ? that every breath is a gift of sweet life from above ? ( george leaves , and goes to the other room ) oh , and before i forget , i have the
checks for first month , last month , security deposit . i have seventy-five dollars left in my account .
jerry : ( looks at the checks ) well .. there 's a little bit of a problem .
elaine : oh , i know . there 's a weak shower spray , i know . i 've already thought about it , and i 'm switching to baths . as winston churchill said , `` why stand when
you can sit ? '' maybe i 'll get some rubber duckies ..
jerry : no , someone offered harold and manny five thousand for the apartment . i 'm sure they 'd just as soon give it to you , but you 'd have to come up with that
money .
elaine : five thousand dollars ? i do n't have five thousand dollars .
jerry : i know .
elaine : how am i going to get five thousand dollars ?
jerry : i have no idea .
( enter kramer )
kramer : hey , my new neighbor !
elaine : i 'm not moving in .

kramer : c'mon , you can come up with five thousand dollars .. jerry , you do n't have five thousand dollars you can led her ? come on .
jerry : yeah , well , i did n't .. is that something you want to borrow ?
elaine : no , that 's too much money to borrow .
kramer : loan her the money . you can afford it .
jerry : she does n't want to borrow the money .
kramer : oh , c'mon . she 'll pay you back . what 's five grand between friends ?
elaine : of course i 'd pay you back ..
kramer : yeah , so what 's the problem ?
jerry : who said there 's a problem ?
kramer : he said he 'd loan you the money .
elaine : well jerry , it might take a while for me to pay you back . maybe a few years . how do you feel about that ?
kramer : that 's okay . he does n't care .
elaine : you know , money can sometimes come between friends .
kramer : get outta here .
elaine : let me think about it .
kramer : what 's to think about ?
elaine : i do n't know .. i do n't know . five thousand .. let me just take one more look at it . ( leaves )
jerry : it was all over ! taken care of . done ! finished . five thousand .. where 's she gon na get five thousand ? she does n't have five thousand . clean . good bye .
she 's gone . then you come in , `` why do n't you loan her five thousand ? what do you care ? you 've got five thousand . give her five thousand . ''
kramer : you did n't want her in the building ?
jerry : no , i did n't !
kramer : well , then what did you loan her the five thousand for ? oh , look , maybe she wo n't take it .. i mean , she did say that she was going to think about it .
jerry : people do n't turn down money ! it 's what separates us from the animals .
kramer : i still do n't understand what the problem is having her in the building .
jerry : let me explain something to you .. you see , you 're not normal . you 're a great guy , i love you , but you 're a pod . i , on the other hand , am a human being . i
sometimes feel awkward , uncomfortable , even inhibited in certain situations with the other human beings . you would n't understand .

'' i 'd like once for a sweepstakes company to have some guts , come out with the truth , just tell people the truth one time . send out envelopes , `` you have definitely lost ! '' you turn it over , giant printing , `` not even close ! '' you open it up , there 's this whole letter of explanation , `` even we can not believe how badly you 've done in this contest . ''

jerry : ( trying to get the box through the door . to kramer ) to the right . ( they get it through )
george : that took awhile .
jerry : ( sarcastic ) do n't get up .
george : i 'd like to help , but my neck ..
( the set the box on the table )
george : so how long has it been in the basement ?
jerry : since my grandfather died . i was suppose to send it down to my parents in florida , but they did n't want it . they told me to get rid of it , but i felt funny and then i sort of forgot about it . and it 's been sitting down there for three years .. until he saw it . ( to kramer ) alright , so , just take what you want and let 's get it out of here .
( they open the box , and start going through it )
george : what 's in it ?
jerry : grandpa clothes . i ca n't wear them .
kramer : ( pulls out some socks ) you want these ? knee socks . you do n't wear knee socks .
jerry : no , go ahead . ( looks around his apartment ) look at this place . i ca n't wait to get it cleaned .
george : i know someone who 'll do it . she 's good . she 's honest .
jerry : no , elaine got this writer friend from finland , rava . her boyfriend goes to columbia grad school , and he 's suppose to do it .
george : students ca n't clean . it 's anathema . ( jerry 's confused ) .. they do n't like it .
jerry : how long have you been waiting to squeeze that into a conversation ?
( kramer pulls a statue out of the box )
kramer : now this , i like .
( george 's eyes light up when he sees the statue )
george : wait a second . i ca n't believe this ! let me see this .
kramer : ( getting possesive ) wait , wait , wait ..
george : let me just see it .
kramer : come on ..
( the both grab it )
george : let me just see it for a second . oh my god , it 's exactly the same !
jerry : what ?
george : when i was ten years old , my parents had this very same statue on the mantle of our apartment . exactly . and , one day , i grabbed it , and i was using it as a microphone . i was singing , `` macarthur park '' , and i got to the part about , `` i 'll never have that recipe again , '' and it slipped out of my hand and it broke . my parents looked at me like i smashed the ten commandments . to this day , they bring it up . it was the single most damaging experience in my life , aside from seeing my father naked .
( george grips the statue , but kramer wont let go . they start to fight for it )
kramer : c'mon , george . i saw it first .
george : no , kramer . i have to have this statue .
kramer : no , i got dibs !
george : what ? no dibs ! i need this statue . c'mon , give it !
jerry : ( stepping in ) spread out , spread out you numbskulls . why do n't you just settle it like mature adults ?
kramer : potato man !
george : no , no , no potato man .. inka-dink .
( kramer and george both visibly add up in their heads to see who would lose if inka-dink was the way to go )
kramer : okay .. start with me .
george : yeah , good , good .
( jerry begins the childish choosing game of inka-dink , pointing alternately between kramer and george with every syllable )
jerry : inka-dink , a bottle of ink . the cork fell out , and you stink . not because you 're dirty , not because you 're clean - just because you kissed the girl behind the magazine .. ( he lands on kramer , then completes the rhyme ) and you are it ! ( lands on george )
kramer : what ? ! wait a minute . no , no , no . what are you doing ? no , no , oh , oh , okay . he 's out . i get it .
george : no , no , no , no .. i 'm `` it '' . i win .
jerry : no , he 's it . he wins . `` it '' is good .
kramer : do over - start with him .
jerry : no , no , no , come on , kramer . now , you got the socks .
( kramer tosses the statue to george )
kramer : alright , you can have it . okay , i 'm gon na take the suit , and the shoes , and the hat .
jerry : alright , c'mon . let 's go .
kramer : hey , i 'll look like joe friday in dragnet . ( hums out the theme song )
george : ( in shock ) i ca n't believe i won at inka-dink .
jerry : come on , let 's go . ( they go to the door . george sets the statue down ) are n't you gon na take it ?
george : no , no , no , i do n't want to carry it around all night . i 'll pick it up later .
goerge : ( to kramer ) what about your stuff ?
kramer : oh , uh , well - okay . ( balls up the clothes he just got , and throws them into his apartment , and leaves )
jerry : alright , let 's go . hey , you know , you owe me one .
george : what ?
jerry : the inka-dink .. you were `` it '' .
george : `` it '' 's bad ?
jerry : `` it '' very bad .

rava : well , if they do n't let you be my editor on this book , i 'll go to another publisher . it 's that simple .
elaine : you told them that ?
rava : of course .
elaine : this is so fantastic . i do n't know how to thank you .
( jerry enters for the bedroom carrying luggage )
jerry : ( frantic ) so , where 's this boyfriend of yours ? i ca n't wait much longer . i 've got a flight .
elaine : oh , probably caught in traffic .
rava : ( serious ) or maybe he 's dead .
jerry : ( joking ) so what do you write , children 's books ?
( there 's a knock at the door )
rava : that 's ray .
( ray enters with cleaning gear )
ray : ah , greetings , greetings , and salutations . i beg your forgiveness . my tardiness was unavoidable . rava , my love . elaine , my dear friend .. and you must be jerry . lord of the manor . ah , my liege . a pleasure to serve you . ( bows )
jerry : ( taken aback ) .. alright .
rava : and we have to get back to work . ( she exits with elaine )
jerry : ( rushed ) i got ta get to the airport .
ray : your place shall sparkle like the stars in heaven upon your save arrival , sire .
jerry : the toilet brush is under the sink .. ( exits )
( scene ends ) [ setting : night club ]
jerry : i do n't really feel that comfortable with a maid , either , because there 's that guilt when you have someone cleaning your house . you know , you 're sitting there on your sofa , and they go by with the vacuum , `` i 'm really sorry about this . i do n't know why i let that stuff over there . '' and that 's why i could never be a maid , because i 'd have an attitude . i 'd find them , whereever they are in the house , `` oh , i suppose you could n't do this ? no , do n't get up , let me clean up your filth . no , you could n't dust . no , this is too tough , is n't it ? ''
( scene ends ) [ setting : jerry 's apartment ]
jerry : he really did an amazing job , look ! he uncoagulated the top of the dishwashing liquid . ( opens refrigerator ) he cleaned out the bottom of the little egg cups . come here , look at this . ( gets on his knees ) he cleaned the little one-inch area between the refrigerator and the counter . how did he get in there ? he must be like rubber man !
elaine : there 's no rubber man .
jerry : .. why did i think there was a rubber man ? there 's elastic man and plastic man .
elaine : i 'm leaving .
jerry : where are you going ?
elaine : to rava 's house . i 've got ta pick up her manuscript .
jerry : wait . i 'll go with you . ( they both go tward the door . jerry opens it ) elaine , he windexed the little peep hole ! ( the leave )
( scene ends ) [ setting : rava 's apartment ]
( jerry , elaine , and rava sit in the living room )
elaine : ( to rava ) so , the meeting with lippman is all set . he 's the editor-in-chief ! i think because of your request ..
rava : demand . ( the sound of locks being unlocked can be heard ) there 's ray .. late as usual .
( ray enters )
ray : well , this is an unexpected surprise - and delight ! the once and future king of comedy , `` jerry the first , '' gracing our humble abode . rava , we 're in the presence of royalty .
jerry : hey , ray , listen , you really did a tremendous job cleaning that apartment .
ray : but i did n't just clean your apartment . it was a ritual , a ceremony , a celebration of life .
jerry : ( joking about his personality ) should n't you be out on a ledge somewhere ?
( they all laugh - ray laughs longer than everyone else . jerry savors the laughs of his big fan - then he sees george 's statue on the mantle of the fireplace . he 's stunned by the sight )
rava : the water is boiling . are you having tea ?
elaine and ray : yes .
( jerry 's still stunned )
elaine : jerry ? .. jerry !
jerry : ( snaps out of it ) what ?
rava : ( from the kitchen ) ray , would you give me a hand ?
ray : yeah , i 'm coming !
( he leaves . as soon as both rava and ray are in the kitchen , jerry and elaine start talking in loud whispers )
jerry : ( points to the statue ) i think that 's the statue from my house . that looks like the statue from my house !
elaine : what statue ?
jerry : i had a statue !
elaine : you have a statue ? i never saw a statue .
jerry : my grandfather gave me a statue !
elaine : since when ?
jerry : what 's the difference ? ! that 's the one ! he ripped me off ! this guy ripped me off !
( ray pops his head back into the living room )
ray : do you take sugar ?
jerry and elaine : uhh .. no .
( ray goes back into the kitchen )
jerry : i ca n't believe it ! this guy ripped me off !
elaine : do you realize what you 're saying ?
jerry : yes ! this guy ripped me off ! he stole that statue right out of my house !
( ray pops in again )
ray : lemon ?
jerry and elaine : ( causual ) uh .. sure , yeah ..
( ray goes back into the kitchen )
elaine : are you sure ?
jerry : pretty sure ! ninety-nine percent sure .
elaine : ninety-nine percent sure ? !
( ray and rava both enter , carrying a tray of tea )
ray : ah , sweet elixir . it 's fragrant nectar - a soothing balm for the soul .
( jerry smells it suspiciously - like it 's poisoned . a ding from the kitchen can be heard )
ray : the pastries !
( ray and rava exit in different directions )
elaine : maybe it just looks the same . maybe it 's just a coincidence .
jerry : coincidence ? this guy 's in my apartment and then , just by coincidence , he has the same exact statue in his apartment .
elaine : i never saw the statue .
jerry : i had a statue ! what should i do ?
elaine : i do n't know .
jerry : .. i 'll call kramer . he can check my house . ( grabs the phone , and dials )
elaine : oh jerry , do n't blow this for me .
jerry : do n't worry .. ( whispering into the phone ) kramer ! kramer ! .. it 's jerry ! .. jerry ! .. from next door ! .. never mind where i am ! .. yes , jerry seinfeld ! .. ( rava enters with a manuscript . jerry starts talking casually )
jerry : ma , i told ya , just dip the bread in the batter , and put in right in the pan . okay , bye . ( hangs up ) my mother .. she forgot how to make french toast . you know how mothers are .
rava : my mother left us when i was six years old . all seven of us . he ever heard from her again . i hope she 's rotting in an alley somewhere .
( a long beat passes )
jerry : my mom 's down in florida .. she 's go one of those condos .. hot down there in the summer . you ever been down there ?
( ray enters with a tray of pastries )
ray : i love these pastries . you know , in scandinavian mythology , the pastries were the food of the gods .
jerry : .. listen , i just remembered .. i 'm .. uh , getting a facial .
elaine : ( takes the manuscript ) oh , see you tomarrow morning .
( they go to leave )
ray : oh , how about dinner ?
jerry : no , i do n't eat dinner . dinner 's for suckers . ( they leave )
( scene ends ) [ setting : jerry 's apartment ]
jerry : ( on the phone ) uh huh .. yeah .. okay , thanks anyway . bye . ( hangs up ) nope , the cop says it 's my word against his . there 's nothing they can do .
kramer : let 's go get him .
jerry : yeah , right .
george : we ca n't just let him get away with this .
jerry : do you realize how crazy he had to be to do something like this ? he knew i was gon na know it 's missing , and he took it ! and of all things to take - i left my watch , tape recorder , stereo . he 's crazy .
kramer : you wanta go get him ?
elaine : well , then , if he 's crazy you should just forget it .
george : forget it ? i already called my parents . i told them to expect the surprise of a lifetime . my mother 's making her roasted potatoes !
elaine : george , do you realize that rava 's asked me to edit her book ?
george : who is this rava ?
kramer : i say we get him .
elaine : no !
george : let me just call him .
jerry : i 'll call him . ( picks up the cordless phone . kramer , george , and elaine all struggle for control of the other - so they can listen in on the conversation . as jerry 's talking , the three others still fight ) hello , ray ? .. hi , ray , this is rava 's friend , elaine 's frined , jerry .. the king of comedy .. right . listen , you know that statue on your mantle , the one with the blue lady ?

jerry and george : no .
( scene ends ) [ setting : coffee shop ]
( jerry sits alone . in the next booth to jerry 's back , george is sitting inconspicuously )
george : ( to jerry , without looking at him ) i thought you said one o ' clock .
jerry : relax , he 's late . he 's always late . it 's part of his `` m.o . ''
george : remember , do n't take any crap .
jerry : yeah , yeah .. do n't worry about it .
george : i 'll be right here .
( ray enters )
jerry : ( sarcastic ) that 's comforting .. shh . he 's here . ( greeting him ) ray ?
ray : ( stands next to the table ) oh , jerry . i ca n't believe you asked me about that statue . do you know how much trouble you could 've got me into ?
jerry : .. well , i did n't ..
ray : rava was standing right next to me . i never told her where i got the statue .
george : ( muttering to himself ) i wonder why .
jerry : well , just give it back , and i wo n't say anything .
ray : give it back ?
jerry : yeah .
ray : what are you talking about ?
jerry : what are you talking about ?
george : ( muttering ) what is he talking about ..
ray : i 'm talking about the statue .
jerry : yeah , me too .
ray : give it back to whom ?
jerry : me .
george : ( to himself ) yeah , him .
ray : you ?
jerry : yeah . me .
ray : i 'm not getting this .
george : ( to himself ) you already got it .
jerry : ray , i had a statue in my house . you were in my house - and then i saw it in your house .
ray : what are you saying ?
jerry : what am i saying ?
george : ( to himself ) take a wild guess .
ray : are you saying i stole your statue ?
george : ( to himself ) what a mind .
jerry : well , i ..
ray : i ca n't believe what i 'm hearing .
jerry : i ca n't believe what i 'm hearing .
george : ( to himself ) i ca n't believe what i 'm hearing .
ray : for your information , i got that statue at a pawn shop .
george : ( to himself ) a pawn shop ?
jerry : a pawn shop ?
ray : yes . in chinatown with the money i earned cleaning people 's apartments .
george : ( to himself ) and cleaning them out .
( jerry elbows george - a message to shut up )
jerry : oh , excuse me .. look , ray , you were the only person in my house .
ray : what 's behind this ? it 's rava , is n't it ?
george : ( to himself ) again with the rava .
ray : you want her .
jerry : ( joking ) no , she 's a little too cheery for me .
ray : ( losing it ) she 's from finland , for crying out loud . finland ! do you understand ? !
jerry : i know finland . they 're neutral .
ray : is it me ? do i rub you the wrong way ?
jerry : no , i actually find you quite charming .. a bit verbose at times .
george : ( mocking ) `` oh , i find you so charming '' .. you wuss .
jerry : ( to george ) did you call me a wuss ?
ray : what did you say ?
jerry : i said luss .. i 'm at a luss ..
ray : i would just love to take you down to the shop where i got it .
jerry : that 's not necessary . ( george slams his menu down on the table in anger ) you know , maybe it 's not that bad an idea .
ray : and i would love to . nothing would please me more . but , unfortunately , the guy retired and moved to singapore .
george : ( muttering to himself ) singapore ? ! do you hear this ?
ray : if you really want , maybe i can contact the guy in singapore aand have him make a photostat of the receipt and send it over .
georgge : that 's it ! that 's it ! i ca n't take it . i ca n't take it anymore ! ( gets up , turns around , and confronts ray ) you stole the statue ! you 're a theif ! you 're a liar !
jerry : ( pleading ) george .
ray : ( to jerry ) who is this ?
george : i 'm the judge and the jury , pal . and the verdict is .. guilty !
ray : what 's going on here ?
george : guilty !
ray : your friend is crazy .
george : oh , i 'm crazy !
jerry : ( still pleading ) george , george ..
ray : i 've got to get going . i have a class .
george : oh ho ! class , huh ? at columbia ? let me tell you something , pal . i called the registrar 's office . i checked you out . they have no record of a ray thomas at that school ! you liar !
ray : well , that 's because i 'm registered under my full legal name , raymond thomas wochinski . ray thomas is my professional name .
george : you mean alias .
ray : you are starting to make me angry .
george : well , that was bound to happen !
ray : ( to jerry ) i hope you think about what you 've done here today .. and if you want to call and apologize , you know where to reach me . ( goes to leave )
jerry : hey , ray .
ray : ( stops ) yes ?
jerry : how did you get the goop out of the top of the dishwashing liquid ? it was like a brand-new nozzle !
( scene ends ) [ setting : pendant publishing ]
( elaine and rava are waiting for an elevator )
elaine : nervous ?
rava : why should i be ?
elaine : yeah . right .
rava : your notes are very insightful .
elaine : the book is great . did you go out last night ?
rava : no . we made love on the floor like two animals . ray is insatiable .
elaine : they all are ..
rava : was jerry ?
elaine : i ca n't remember ..
( doors open . they step in )
rava : you know , ray is very upset over these accusations .
elaine : oh , well , i 'm staying out of this one . this is between them . i am not getting involved .
( the doors close . scene cuts to moments later , on another floor . the doors open )
rava : ( annoyed ) so you think he stole it ? !
elaine : well , you have to admit .. the circumstantial evidence .
rava : i admit nothing !
( the doors close . scene cuts to the inside of the elevator )
man : will you put that cigarette out , please ?
( rava ignores him )
elaine : well , i mean , he was in the apartment , and then it 's gon and it 's in your apartment .
rava : maybe you think we 're in cahoots .
elaine : no , no .. but it is quite a coincidence .
rava : yes , that 's all , a coincidence !
elaine : a big coincidence .
rava : not a big coincidence . a coincidence !
elaine : no , that 's a big coincidence .
rava : that 's what a coincidence is ! there are no small coincidences and big coincidences !
elaine : no , there are degrees of coincidences .
rava : no , there are only coincidences ! .. ask anyone ! ( enraged , she asks everone in the elevator ) are there big coincidences and small coincidences , or just coincidences ? ( silent ) .. well ? ! well ? ! ..
( everyone just kinda shrugs , then murmurs . the doors open )
man : will you put that cigarette out ? !
rava : ( pointing the lit end at him ) maybe i put it out on your face ! ( to elaine ) it 's just like ray said - you and jerry are jealous of our love . you 're trying to destroy us .
elaine : should n't you be out on a ledge somewhere ?
( the doors close . scene cuts to another floor . the elevator is empty except for elaine . there 's a janitor 's cart parked right outside the doors . she steps out , then throws the manuscript into the garbage can of the cart , and exits )
( scene ends ) [ setting : jerry 's apartment ]
george : ( on the phone ) ma , will you stop ? .. it 's just a statue ! how is it my fault ? ! .. it was stolen . i did n't even touch it this time .. okay , fine . i do n't se why this should affect to potatoes ! okay . goodbye . ( hangs up ) she does n't react to disappointement very well .. unlike me .
kramer : i 'm not happy about this .
elaine : why do n't we just throw a molotov cocktail through their window ?
george : there 's just no justice . this experience has changed me . it 's made me more cynical , more bitter , more jaded .
jerry : really ?
george : ( casually ) sure . why not ?
elaine : well , how do you think i feel ? instead of editing the first novel of a major young writing talent , i am proofreading a food allergy cookbook .
jerry : ca n't you talk to your boss ?
elaine : i did . he loves rava .. worse .. he loves ray , and he does n't think you 're funny at all .
kramer : i 'm not happy about this .
jerry : well , perhaps we can take comfort in the knowledge that in the next world , ray will be the recipient of a much larger and more harsh brand of justice ..
george : yeah .. he 'll have my parents !
( scene ends ) [ setting : rava and ray 's apartment ]
( ray 's home alone . there 's a knock at the door )
kramer : police ! open up !
ray : police ? ( opens the door a crack - kramer barges in like a cop . he 's wearing jerry 's grandfather 's suit and hat . he forces ray against the wall - face first )
kramer : freeze , mother !
ray : hey ..
( kramer shoves him roughly against the wall )
kramer : shut up . spread 'em . i said spread 'em ! ( looks around ) you 're in big trouble son . burglary , grand larceny , possession of stolen goods .. and uh , uh .. murder .
ray : murder ? !
( kramer shoves him against the wall )
kramer : shut up ! keep 'em spread ! just make love to that wall , pervert !
ray : i think you have me confused with somebody else .
kramer : ( afraid he 's got the wrong guy ) is your name ray ?
ray : yeah .
kramer : ( assured ) yeah , you 're the punk i 'm looking for . ( grabs the statue from the mantle , and puts it in his bag )
ray : hey , hey , are you a cop ?
kramer : yeah , i 'm a cop . i 'm a good cop . i 'm a damn good cop ! today 's your lucky day , junior , 'cause i 'm gon na let you off with a warning . any more of this criminal activity , and you 'll be sorry . you got me ?
ray : got you ? i do n't even know what the hell you 're talking about .
kramer : good . good . let 's keep it that way . ( exits )

( kramer guides jerry , elaine , and george into the apartment )
jerry : alright , alright . what 's the big hubbub , bub ?
( kramer runs to his apartment , then returns with a duffel bag . he places it on the table , and reveals the statue )
george : kramer , i ca n't believe it . oh , you 're my hero !
kramer : yeah .
jerry : kramer , what did you do ?
kramer : well , let 's put it this way : i did n't take him to people 's court .
george : i feel like a huge weight 's been lifted off my shoulders . ( giddily ) i .. i .. i feel happy ! kramer , i do n't know how to thank you !
kramer : well , i 'll think of something .. ( slaps george on the back - sending the statue crashing to the ground )
( scene ends ) [ setting : night club ]
jerry : people are going to steal from you . you ca n't stop them . but , everybody has their own little personal security things - things that they think will foil the crooks , you know ? in your own mind , right ? .. you go to the beach , go in the water , put your wallet in the sneaker . who 's gon na know ? what criminal mind could penetrate this fortress of security ? i tied a bow . they ca n't get through that . i put the wallet down by the toe of the sneaker . they never look there . they check the heel , they move on .
end of show .
levitan : remind me to tell you what we did in lake george . [ laughing ] get
this ... i got it all on video . [ laughing ]
george : that 's it . this is it . i 'm done . through . it 's over . i 'm gone .
finished . over . i will never work for you again . look at you .
[ laughing ] you think you 're an important man ? is that what you think ? you
are a laughingstock . you are a joke . these people are laughing at
you . you 're nothing ! you have no brains , no ability , nothing ! [ knocking
object over on desk ] i quit !

kramer : hey .
jerry : hey .
kramer : boy , i have really had it with newman . he wakes me up again last
night at three o'clock in the morning to tell me he 's going up onto the
roof to kill himself .
jerry : well , what 'd you say ?
kramer : i said `` jump . '' well , he 's been threatening to do this for years . i
said `` look , if you 're gon na kill yourself do it already and stop
bothering me . '' at least i 'd respect the guy for accomplishing something .
jerry : what 's his problem ?
kramer : no job . no women .
jerry : he called the right guy .
kramer : what am i supposed to tell him ? how much there is for him to live
for ? why should i lie to him ?
jerry : all right , i 'm leaving . i going to the laundry .
kramer : why do n't you use the machines down in the basement ?
jerry : fluff and fold . the only way to live . [ snapping fingers in tune with
words ] i drop it off . i pick it up . it 's a delight .
kramer : how 'bout if i put a few things --
jerry : wait a sec . i do n't wan na do --
kramer : well , you 're going over there .
jerry : i do n't wan na mix in everything ! my guys do n't know your guys . you
ca n't just lock 'em all in the same machine together . they 'll start a
riot .
kramer : have you ever met my guys ?
jerry : no . i ca n't say as i have .
kramer : well !
jerry : all right . put 'em on top .
kramer : ah !

jerry : oh , beautiful . this stuff on top is my friends ' . could i get it done
in a separate machine ?
vic : i 'll have to charge you for another machine .
jerry : whatever it costs . in fact , i would prefer it if the machines are
not even touching each other . because something could , you know , jump
across .
george : guess what .
jerry : how did you know i was here ?
george : kramer . guess what .
jerry : i do n't know .
george : i quit my job .
jerry : get outta here .
george : i could n't take it anymore .
vic : you can have this on monday .

george : i go in to use his private bathroom , everybody uses it , and then i
get a memo - a memo - telling me to use the men 's room in the hall .
well , [ laughing ] we share it with pace electronics . it 's disgusting !
jerry : you and your toilets .
george : i snapped ! it was the last straw . [ sighs ]
jerry : so , what are you gon na do now ? are you gon na look for something else
in real estate ?
george : nobody 's hiring now . the market 's terrible .
jerry : so what are you gon na do ?
george : i like sports . i could do something in sports .
jerry : uh-huh . uh-huh . in what capacity ?
george : you know , like the general manager of a baseball team or something .
jerry : yeah . well , that - that could be tough to get .
george : well , it does n't even have to be the general manager . maybe i could
be like , an announcer . like a caller man . you know how i always make
those interesting comments during the game .
jerry : yeah . yeah . you make good comments .
george : what about that ?
jerry : well , they tend to give those jobs to ex-ballplayers and people that

george : movies . i like to watch movies .

concrete all over machine ]
jerry : what about the gentle cycle ? you ever use that ?
[ opening lid , kramer begins to contort & flail arms about as a cloud of
concrete covers his face ]
jerry : do you think it 's effeminate for a man to put clothes in a gentle
cycle ?
[ kramer emptying bag into machine ]
jerry : what about fine fabrics ? how do you deal with that kind of
temperament ?
[ finished with machine , kramer walks to corner of room with half-full bag &
drops it on the floor ]
[ kramer giving `` ok '' sign ]
[ kramer starting machine & trying to brush the mounds of concrete off of
the machine ]
jerry : what about stone washing ? you ever witness one of those ? that must

dry concrete ]

levitan : and all the people in this room , [ clears throat ] that made that
possible ..
george : rick .
levitan : i 'd also like to welcome back into the fold our .. our little
shrimpy friend , george costanza who , although he did n't really have a
very good year -- how you blew that mcconnell deal , i 'll never know . but ,
hey , what the hell , huh ? we 've always enjoyed his antics around the
office . heh heh . anything you wan na add to this ?
george : drink up . i like history . civil war . maybe i could be a professor ,
or something .
elaine : well , to teach something you really have to know a lot about it . i
think you need a degree .
jerry : yeah . that 's true . what ? my god , the money ! the 1500 ! where 'd you
find it ?
kramer : it was in my laundry .
jerry : in your laundry the whole time ? i told you not to mix in our guys .
what did we figure the damage on that machine would be ?
kramer : it was about 1200 bucks .
newman : kramer !
kramer : oh ! that 's newman .
newman : i 'm on the roof !
kramer : well , what are you waiting for ?
jerry : elaine , come on , take a walk with me down to the laundromat . i got ta
pay this guy the money ..
george : i like horses . maybe i could be a stable boy .
kramer : you wan na shoot some pool tonight ?
newman : i ca n't . i 'm goin ' to the movies .
george : nah . it 's probably a union thing .
[ setting : night club ]
jerry : you know , i tell ya , i got ta say that i 'm enjoying adulthood . for a lot of reasons . and , i 'll tell you reason number one : as an adult , if i want a cookie , i have
a cookie , okay ? i have three cookies or four cookies , or eleven cookies if i want . many times i will intentionally ruin my entire appetite . just ruin it . and then , i call
my mother up right after to tell her that i did it . `` hello , mom ? yeah , i just ruined my entire appetite .. cookies . '' so what if you ruin .. see , because as an adult , we
understand even if you ruin an appetite , there 's another appetite coming right behind it . there 's no danger in running out of appetites . i 've got millions of them , i 'll ruin
them whenever i want !

george : let me see that . ( studies the note )
elaine : hey , where 's kramer ?
jerry : i do n't know . that 's like asking `` where 's waldo ? ''
george : ( still holding the note ) i think i 'm having a heart attack .
jerry : i do n't think that 's it .
george : i 'm not kidding .
jerry : what does that mean ?
elaine : i think what he 's trying to say is that he 's having a heart attack .
jerry : oh , he 's having a heart attack .
george : tightness ..
jerry : c'mon .
george : shortness of breath ..
jerry : oh , this is ridiculous .
george : radiating waves of pain ..
jerry : i know what this is . you saw that show on pbs last night , coronary country . ( to elaine ) i saw it in the tv guide . i called him and told him to make sure
and not watch it .
george : there was nothing else on . oh , the left arm .. the left arm .
jerry : ( to elaine ) he saw that show on anorexia last year , and ate like an animal for two weeks .
george : why ca n't i have a heart attack ? i 'm allowed .
jerry : so what do you want ? you want me take you to the hospital ?
george : manhattan memorial , less of a line .
jerry : i 'll call an ambulance . ( exits )
( a waitress approaches . george is dying , but the waitress does n't seem to notice )

[ setting : hospital room ]
( george lies in the bed . he has ekg cups on his chest , a tube up his nose , and an iv in his arm . the man in the neighboring bed seems to be in pain )

( scene goes to jerry . he 's standing at the doorway , showing the note to a nurse )
jerry : well ? what do you think ?
nurse 1 : `` salami , salami , bologna . '' definitely .
jerry : `` salami salami bologna '' ?
doctor : ( in a hurry ) oh , your friend 's fine . he did n't have a heart attack . i 'll be in - in a few minutes .
jerry : ( sarcastic ) what a surprise . ( enters george 's room overly sympathetic - leading george to think that the doctor told jerry something significant ) hey , how
ya doin ' buddy ? you need anything ? do you want me to go out and get you a superman comic ?
george : no , no thanks .
jerry : ( still going along with the practical joke ) you know , i was wondering .. you know that black hawks jacket you have ?
george : oh , sure , my black hawks jacket . i love my black hawks jacket .
jerry : well , you know , i was thinking - if things do n't exactly work out ..
george : well , it would n't fit you . the sleeves are too short .
jerry : no , i tried it on . it fits good .
george : well , i did n't really think about what i was gon na do with all ..
jerry : well , you know ..
george : ( reluctantly ) well , okay .
jerry : oh , and .. do you think it would be alright if i called susan davis ?
george : susan davis ? ( getting possessive ) hey , wait a second ..
jerry : well , it 's not like we 'd be bumping into you .
george : i do n't know .. you and susan davis ?
jerry : you know , if your future was a little more certain ..
george : okay , go ahead . call her , get married , have babies , have a great life .. what do i care ? i 'm finished . ( really depressed ) it 's all over for me . in fact , let 's

jerry : well , ah .. ( takes his pillow ) what ? kind of like this ? ( violently smothers george with the pillow . george freaks out . he did n't think jerry would actually
do it )
george : what are ya doing ? ! whadya , crazy ? !
( elaine enters - she gets a clear shot of jerry 's jokingly trying to kill george )
elaine : jerry !
jerry : ( acts like he was cought red-handed ) elaine , what are you doing here ? ( takes the pillow off george , and puts it back on his bed )
george : ( to jerry ) jerk off .
( jerry goes over to elaine )
jerry : ( whispering ) there 's nothing wrong with him . i saw the doctor . he 's fine .
( they both go to george 's bed . elaine decides to go along with jerry 's joke )
elaine : hi , george . how ya feeling ? is anybody getting your apartment ?
( jerry and elaine both sit down , and have their own conversation . they completely ignore george )
george : i 'll tell ya , if i ever get out of here , i 'm gon na change my life . i 'm gon na do a whole zen thing . take up yoga , meditate .. i 'll eat right . calm down , lose my
anger .. ( sees jerry and elaine are n't listening . he snaps ) hey , is anybody listening ? !
( the doctor enters . elaine and the doctor exchange an awkward , romantic glance )
doctor : ( to elaine ) uh , hello . ( to george ) uh , mr. costanza ?
george : ( panicky ) uh , yeah . you know , doctor , i got ta tell you , i feel a lot better .
doctor : well , we looked at your ekg 's , ran some tests , did a complete work-up .
george : ( getting in a more panicked state ) oh god , mommy !
doctor : and you simply have n't had a heart attack .
george : ( relieved ) i have n't ? i 'm okay ? i 'm okay ? oh , thank you , thank you , doctor ! i do n't know how to thank you .
jerry : ( sarcastic ) hey , that was really fun , george . can we go home now ?
doctor : no , actually , we 'd like to keep him here overnight for observation , just to be safe .
george : oh , sure . sure , anything . can you believe it ? there 's nothing wrong with me .
doctor : well , i would n't go that far .
george : ( starting to panic again ) what ? oh my god . what ? is it meningitis ? scoliosis ? lupis ? ! is it lupis ? !
doctor : have you ever had your tonsils taken out ?
george : my tonsils ? yeah , when i was a kid .
doctor : well , they 've grown back . your adenoids are swollen too .
george : really ?
elaine : ( jokingly hits the doctor ) whose tonsils grow back ? ( laughs )
doctor : it happens .
jerry : yeah , if you 've been exposed to gamma rays .
elaine : i still have my tonsils . everyone in my family has their tonsils . in fact , we were forbidden to socialize with anyone who did n't have their tonsils .
doctor : that 's interesting . because , no one in my family has their tonsils , and we were forbidden to socialize with tonsil people .
jerry : ( sarcastically ) well , it 's like the capulets and the montagues .
george : ( drawing attention back to him ) excuse me !
doctor : anyway , i strongly recommend they come out .
george : what ? you mean with a knife ?
doctor : yes . with a knife . you know , snip , snip . anyway , you 'd be completely under , you would n't feel a thing . and when you wake up , you can have some ice
cream .
george : ( angry ) yeah , that 's what they told me the last time .
doctor : think about it . ( turns to leave , but runs into elaine ) excuse me .
elaine : ( flustered ) oh , i 'm sorry . ( doctor exits ) i just .. have to ask that doctor one more question . ( leaves )
jerry : women go after doctors like men go after models . they want someone with knowledge of the body .. we just want the body .
( kramer enters , eating off a tray of hospital food )
kramer : hey .
jerry : hey .
kramer : boy , they got a great cafeteria downstairs . hot food , sandwiches , a salad bar .. it 's like a sizzler 's opened up a hospital ! ( sits and starts eating ) so , how
did you have a heart attack ? you 're a young man . what were you doing ? are they gon na do a zipper job ? oh , they love to do zipper jobs .
jerry : ( trying to shut him up ) kramer .
kramer : the really bad thing about the heart is the sex thing . see , you got ta be careful about sex now . you get that heart pumping and suddenly , boom ! next
thing you know , you got a hose coming out of your chest attached to a piece of luggage .
jerry : kramer , george did n't have a heart attack .
kramer : no ? that 's good .
george : i have to have my tonsils taken out .
kramer : oh man .. no .. george , we got ta get you outta here . get out ! right now ! they 'll kill ya in here .
jerry : ( trying to calm george down ) it 's routine surgery .
kramer : oh yeah ? my friend , bob saccomanno , he came in here for a hernia operation .. oh yeah , routine surgery .. now he 's sittin ' around in a chair by a
window going , `` my name is bob '' .. george , whatever you do , do n't let 'em cut you . do n't let 'em cut you ..
george : well , what should i do , kramer ?
jerry : well , for one think , do n't listen to him .
kramer : i 'll tell you what to do , i 'll tell you what to do . you go to tor eckman . tor , tor , he 'll fix you right up . he 's a herbalist , a healer , george . he 's not just
gon na fix the tonsils and the adenoids , he is gon na change the whole way you function - body and mind .
jerry : eckman ? i thought he was doing time ?
kramer : no , no , he 's out . he got out . see , the medical establishment , see , they tried to frame him . it 's all politics . but he 's a rebel .
jerry : a rebel ? no . johnny yuma was a rebel . eckman is a nut . george , you want to take care of your tonsils , you do it in a hospital . with a doctor .
kramer : he 's holistic , george . he 's holistic .
george : holistic .. that sounds right .
jerry : george , you need a medical doctor .
george : ( to jerry ) let me ask you something .. how much do you think it would cost to have tonsils and adenoids removed in the hospital ?
jerry : well , an overnight stay in a hospital ? minor surgery ? i dunno , four grand .
george : uh-huh . and how much does the healer charge ?
kramer : first visit ? thirty-eight bucks .
george : oh , yeah ? holistic .. that 's what i need . that 's the answer .
( scene ends )
[ setting : healer 's apartment ]
( jerry and george are sitting on huge pillows on the apartment floor . kramers fiddling with an acupuncture model )
george : so , how do you like the way i talked you into comin ' down here ?
jerry : do n't flatter yourself , my friend . i 'm here strictly for material , and i have a feeling this is a potential gold mine .. i still think you 're nuts , though .
george : all i know is i 've been going to doctors all my life . what has it gotten me ? i 'm thirty-three years old . i have n't outgrown the problems of puberty , i 'm
already facing the problems of old age . i completely skipped healthy adulthood . i went from having orgasms immediately to taking forever . you could do your taxes
in the time it takes me to have an orgasm . i 've never had a normal , medium orgasm .
jerry : ( jokingly making fun of george ) i 've never had a really good pickle .
george : besides , what 's it gon na cost me ? thirty-eight bucks ?
( tor enters . he hugs kramer for a long time , then walks over to jerry and george )
tor : ( to jerry ) would you not put your foot on that please ?
jerry : sorry .
( tor sits down , and turns tward george )
tor : what month were you born ?
george : april .
tor : you should have been born in august . your parents would have been well-advised to wait .
george : really ?
tor : do you use hot water in the shower ?
george : yes .
tor : stop using it .
george : .. okay .
kramer : i 'm off hot water .
tor : kramer tells me that you are interested in an alternative to surgery .
george : yes , yes i am .
tor : ( blows into george 's face ) i think we can help you . see , unfortunately , the medical establishment is a business like any other business . and business needs
customers . and , they want to sell you their most expensive item which is unnecessary surgery .
george : ( still on the showers ) can i use hot water on my face ?
tor : no . you know , i am not a business man . i 'm a holistic healer . it 's a calling , it 's a gift . you see , it 's in the best interest of the medical profession that you remain
sick . you see , that insures good business . you 're not a patient . you 're a customer .
jerry : ( he thinks this , the audience can hear his thoughts ) and you 're not a doctor , but you play one in real life .
george : ( still on the hot water ) what about shaving ?

elaine : it 's almost stupid if we did n't .
jerry : it 's moronic .
elaine : absurd !
jerry : of course , i guess , maybe , some little problems could arise .
elaine : we , there are always a few .
jerry : i mean , if anything happened , and we could n't be friends the way we are now , that would be really bad .
elaine : devastating .
jerry : because this is very good . ( points back and forth between them to indicate friendship )
elaine : and that would be good . ( points to bedroom )
jerry : that would be good too . the idea is combine the this and the that . but this can not be disturbed .
elaine : yeah , we just wan na take this and add that .
jerry : but of course , we 'd have to figure out a way to avoid the things that cause the little problems . maybe some rules or something .
elaine : huh .
jerry : for example , now , i call you whenever i 'm inclined and vice versa .
elaine : right .
jerry : but if we did that , we might feel a certain obligation to call .
elaine : well why should that be ? oh , i have an idea . i have an idea . no call the day after that .
jerry : beautiful . let 's make it a rule .
elaine : all right , sir .
jerry : now here 's another little rule . when we see each other now , we retire to our separate quarters . but sometimes , when people get involved with that , they feel pressure to sleep over . when that is not really sleep . sleep is separate from that . and i do n't see why sleep got all tied up and connected with that .
elaine : okay , okay . spending the night is optional !
jerry : well now we 're gettin ' somewhere .
elaine : what about the kiss goodnight ?
jerry : tough one . you 're call .

jerry : about eleven .
george : okay , go ahead .
jerry : so she 's flipping around the tv , and she gets to the naked station .
george : oh , see ? that 's why i do n't have cable in my house . because of that naked station . if i had that in my house , i would never turn it off . i would n't sleep , i would n't eat . eventually , firemen would have to break through the door , they 'd find me sitting there in my pajamas with drool coming down my face . all right , all right . so you 're watching the naked station .
jerry : and then , somehow , we started talking about , what if we had sex .
george : boy , these are really bad details .
jerry : it pains me to say this , but i may be getting to mature for details .
george : oh i hate to hear this . that kind of growth really irritates me .
jerry : well . i 'll tell you though . it was really passionate .
george : better than before ?
jerry : she must 've taken some kind of seminar or something .
george : this is all too much . so what are you feeling ? what 's going on ? are you like a couple again now ?
jerry : not exactly .
george : not exactly . what does that mean ?
jerry : well , we 've tried to arrange a situation where we 'll be able to do this once in a while and still be friends . ( george laughs hysterically and stands oiut of his seat )
george : where are you living ? are you here ? are you on this planet ? it 's impossible . it ca n't be done . ( he sits back down ) thousands of years people have been trying to have their cake and eat it too . so all of a sudden the two of you are going to come along and do it . where do you get the ego ? no one can do it . it ca n't be done .
jerry : i think we 've worked out a system .
george : oh , you know what you 're like ? you 're like a pathetic gambler . you 're one of those losers in las vegas who keeps thinking he 's gon na come up with a way to win at blackjack .
jerry : no , this is very advanced . we 've designed at set of rules that we can maintain the friendship by advancing all of the relationship pitfalls .
george : sure , all right . tell me the rules .
jerry : okay . no calls the next day .
george : ( to himself ) so you 're havin ' the sex , next day you do n't have to call . that 's pretty good . ( back to jerry ) go ahead .
jerry : you ready for the second one ?
george : i have tell you , i 'm pretty impressed with the first one .
jerry : spending the night . optional .
george : no , you see ? you got greedy .
jerry : no , that 's the rule . it 's optional .
george : i know less about women than anyone in the world . but one thing i do know is they 're not happy if you do n't spend the night . i could be a hot , sweaty room with no air conditioning and all they have is a little army cot this wide ( displays with french fry ) you 're not going anywhere .
jerry : i think you 're wrong .
george : i hope i am .

show is before i change the channel . '' you see ? men just fly . because women , you see , women nest and men hunt . that 's why we watch tv differently . before
there was flipping around , before there was television , kings and emperors and pharaohs and such had story-tellers that would tell them stories 'cause that was their
entertainment . i always wonder , in that era , if they would get , like , thirty story-tellers together so they could still flip around . just go , `` alright start telling me a story ,

george : god ! she 's cooking dinner for god ! she 's yelling and screaming , and the next thing i know , she throws a big can of chocolate syrup all over my new red
shirt .
elaine : it was an accident !
george : oh , yeah , sure , accident , right . she was aiming right at me like she was putting out a fire ! then , for the rest of the show , i 'm sitting there with chocolate all
over my shirt . flies are landing on me . i 'm boiling - i 'm fantasizing all the things i 'm gon na say when i see her . and later , finally , backstage when i talk to her , i 'm a
groveling worm . `` what kind of chocolate was that ? do you throw any other foods ? ''
jerry : ( to elaine ) he thought he still had a shot .
george : and then , then , then she leaves with somebody else ! never even , never even said goodbye ! never called me back .. never apologized . nothing . like i
was dirt .

george : let maria shriver give her a baby shower .
jerry : ask not what i can do for you - ask what you can do for me .

elaine : oh , would you two stop with the kennedys ? why does everybody make such a big deal about he kennedys ? what is this fascination ? ! who cares ? ! it 's
all so boring ..

elaine : see , i was gon na give the shower in my apartment ..
jerry : but ?

elaine : she has this in addition to epstein-barr . it 's like epstein-barr with a twist of lyme disease .
jerry : how did she get lyme disease ?
elaine : i do n't know . she did some outdoor version of hair in danbury , connecticut .
jerry : they still do that play ?
elaine : it 's a classic .

george : ( still mad a leslie ) never said goodbye . goodbye !
jerry : explain to me how this baby shower thing works .
elaine : what do you wan na know ?
jerry : well , i mean , does it ever erupt into a drunken orgy of violence ?

jerry : saturday ? .. well , i have a show in buffalo on saturday . they 're not gon na bust up my apartment , or anything , are they ?

george : does she care ? no . does anyone ever display the slightest sensitivity
over the problems of a fellow individual ? no . no . a resounding no !
( guy on phone approaches george )
guy : hey , sorry i took so long .
george : oh that 's ok , really , do n't worry about it .
elaine : how do people fast ? did ghandi get this crazy ? i 'm gon na walk around ,
see what dishes look good .
jerry : i told my uncle i had a stomach ache tonight . you think he bought that ?
george : yeah , well , he probably bought it .
jerry : so what happened with tatiana ?
george : i should n't even tell you this .
jerry : come on ...
george : well , after dinner last week , she invites me back to her apartment .
jerry : i 'm with you .
george : well , it 's this little place with this little bathroom . it 's like
right there , you know , it 's not even down a little hall or off in an alcove .
you understand ? there 's no ... buffer zone . so , we start to fool around , and
it 's the first time , and it 's early in the going . and i begin to perceive this
impending ... intestinal requirement , whose needs are going to surpass by great
lengths anything in the sexual realm . so i know i 'm gon na have to stop . and as
this is happening i 'm thinking , even if i can somehow manage to momentarily ...
extricate myself from the proceedings and relieve this unstoppable force , i know
that that bathroom is not gon na provide me with the privacy that i know i 'm
going to need ...
jerry : this could only happen to you .
george : so i finally stop and say , `` tatiana , i hope you do n't take this the
wrong way , but i think it would be best if i left '' .
jerry : you said this to her after .
george : no . during .
jerry : oh , boy .
george : yeah .
jerry : wow ! so ... ?
george : so i 'm dressing and she 's staring up at me , struggling to compute this
unprecedented turn of events . i do n't know what to say to reassure this woman ,
and worst of all , i do n't have the time to say it . the only excuse she might
possibly have accepted is if i told her i am in reality batman , and i 'm very
sorry , i just saw the bat-signal . it took me 3 days of phone calls to get her
to agree to see me again . now she 's waiting for me to call her , and she 's
( gestures towards woman on phone ) still on the phone .
( elaine comes over )
elaine : i hate this place . i do n't know why we came here , i 'm never coming back
here again .
jerry ( still trying to remember ) : who is that woman ? !
elaine : remember when you first went out to eat with your parents ? remember ,
it was such a treat to go and they serve you this different food that you never
saw before , and they put it in front of you , and it is such a delicious and
exciting adventure ? and now i just feel like a big sweaty hog waiting for them
to fill up the trough .
george : she 's off . ( goes over to the now available public phone )
elaine : jerry , talk to that guy again .
jerry : what am i gon na say ?
elaine : tell him we wan na catch a movie and that we 're late .
( as jerry approaches bruce , a man walks in )
mr. cohen : hey , what stinks in here ?
bruce ( laughing ) : mr. cohen ! have n't seen you for a couple of weeks .
mr. cohen : well , i 've been looking for a better place .
( bruce laughs )
bruce : better place ... want a table ?
mr. cohen : no , just bring me a plate and i 'll eat here .
bruce ( laughing ) : give him a plate and you eat here ... come on , i give you a
table .
jerry : excuse me ... we 've been waiting here . now , i know we were ahead of that
guy , he just came in .
bruce : oh no , mr. cohen always here .
elaine : he 's always here ? what does that mean ? what does that mean ?
bruce : oh , mr. cohen , very nice man . he live on park avenue .
elaine : where am i ? is this a dream ? what in god 's name is going on here ? !
george : she 's not there . she left . she must 've waited and left because those
people would n't get off the phone .
jerry : didja leave a message ?
george : yeah , i told her to call me here and to tell anyone who answers the
phone to ask for a balding , stocky man with glasses . i better tell him i 'm
expecting a call .
elaine : oh , jerry , here comes that woman ...
jerry : where do i know her ?
( woman in stripes approaches jerry )
lorraine : hello , jerry !
jerry : heeeeyyyy ... how you doin ' ?
lorraine : how is everything ?
jerry : good , good , good ... what 's goin ' on ?
lorraine : oh , working hard . and you ?
jerry : oh , you know , working around , same stuff , doing ... whatever .
lorraine : you have n't been around in a while .
jerry : i know , i know ... well , you know .
lorraine : you should come by .
jerry : definitely . i plan to , i 'm not just saying that .
elaine : hi , i 'm elaine .
lorraine ( shaking her hand ) : lorraine . catalano .
jerry : i 'm sorry , lorraine , this is elaine ...
( they all laugh , then silent )
lorraine : well it was nice seeing you , jerry . and nice meeting you . ( she
leaves )
elaine ( smug ) : oh , nice to meet you too , lorraine !
jerry : oh my god , lorraine ... that 's lorraine from my uncle 's office . i 'm in
big , big trouble .
elaine : the one you broke the plans with tonight ?
jerry : yeah , she works in his office . now she 's gon na see him tomorrow and
tell him she saw me here tonight . he 's gon na tell his wife , his wife 's gon na
call my mother . oh , this is bad , you do n't know , the chain reaction of calls
this is gon na set off . new york , long island , florida , it 's like the bermuda
triangle . unfortunately , nobody ever disappears . my uncle to my aunt , my aunt
to my mother , my mother to my uncle ...
jerry : ... my uncle to my cousin , my cousin to my sister , my sister to me .
elaine : you should 've just had dinner with your uncle tonight and gotten in
over with . it 's just a movie .
jerry : just a movie ? ! you do n't understand . this is n't 'plans 1 through 8
from outer space ' , this is 'plan 9 ' , this is the one that worked . the worst
movie ever made !
( elaine nods )
jerry : hey , i got news for you , if we 're making this movie , we got ta get a
table immediately .
elaine : alright , ok. let 's stop fooling around . let 's just slip him some
money .
jerry : in a chinese restaurant ? do they take money ?
elaine : do they take money ? everyone takes money . i used to go out with a guy
who did it all the time , you just slip him 20 bucks .
george : 20 bucks ? is n't that excessive ?
elaine : well what do you want to give him , change ?
george : it 's more than the meal !
jerry : oh , come on , we 'll divide it up three ways .
george : alright . 7,7 , ( points at himself ) 6. i 'm not gon na eat that much !
jerry : i 'm counting your shrimps . ok , who 's gon na do it ?
george : oh no , i ca n't do it . i-i 'm not good at these things , i get flustered .
once i tried to bribe an usher at the roller derby , i almost got arrested .
elaine : i guess it 's you , jer .
jerry : me ? what about you ?
elaine : oh , i ca n't do that , it 's a guy thing .
jerry : the woman 's movement just ca n't seem to make any progress in the world
of bribery , can they ?
elaine : give me the money .
( elaine stands close to bruce , trying to get his attention )
elaine : how 's it going ' ?
bruce : very busy .
( elaine holds the money in front of bruce )
elaine : boy , we are really anxious to sit down .
bruce : very good specials tonight .
( elaine puts the bill on the open reservations book )
elaine : if there 's anything you can do to get us a table we 'd really appreciate
it .
bruce : what is your name ? ( he turns the page over the money )
elaine : no no , i want to eat now ! ( she gets the money from under the page )
bruce : yes , we have sea-bass dinner tonight , very fresh .
elaine ( gives him the money ) : here , take this . i 'm starving . take it ! take
it !
( bruce shrugs and takes it )
bruce : dennison , 4 ! ( goes over to 4 ladies ) your table is ready .
elaine : no no , no , i want that table . i want that table ! oh , come on , did you
see that ? what was that ? he took the money , he did n't give us a table .
jerry : you lost the 20 .
elaine : well , how could he do that ?
george : you did n't make it clear .
elaine : make it clear ?
jerry : what a sorry exhibition that was . alright , let me get the money back .
( goes over to bruce ) excuse me . i realize , this is extremely embarrassing , my
friend here apparently made a mistake .
bruce : your name ?
jerry : seinfeld .
bruce : yeah , seinfeld 4 !
jerry : no no no , you see the girl there , with the long hair ?
( elaine waves at him , smiling )
bruce : oh yes , yes . very beautiful girl , very beautiful . is your girlfriend ?
jerry : well , actually , we did date for a while , but ... it 's really not relevant
here .
bruce : relationships are difficult . it 's very hard to stay together-
jerry : alright , listen , alright . how much longer is it gon na be ?
bruce : oh . in about five , ten minutes .
( jerry goes over to elaine and george )
george : so ?
jerry : there seems to be a bit of a discrepancy .
elaine : so when are we gon na eat ?
jerry : five , ten minutes .
george : we should have left earlier . i told you .
jerry : i do n't see any way we can eat and make this movie .
elaine : oh , well i have to eat .
jerry : well let 's just order to go , we 'll eat it in the cab .
elaine : eat it in the cab ? chinese food in a cab ?
jerry : we 'll eat it in the movie .
elaine : oh , who do you think you 're going ? do you think that they have big
picnic tables there ?
jerry : well what do you suggest ?
elaine : i say we leave now , we go to 'skyburger ' and we scarf 'em down .
jerry : i 'm not going to 'skyburger ' . besides , it 's in the opposite direction ,
let 's just eat popcorn or something .
bruce ( holding a phone ) : cartwright ?
elaine : i ca n't have popcorn for dinner !
bruce : cartwright ?
elaine ( tries to snatch food off a waiter 's tray ) : i have to eat !
jerry : so they have hotdogs there .
elaine : oh , movie hotdogs ! i rather lick the food off the floor .
george : i ca n't go anywhere , i have to wait here for tatiana 's call . let me
just check .
( goes over to bruce )
george : excuse me , i 'm expecting a call . costanza ?
bruce : yeah , i just got a call . i yell 'cartwright ! cartwright ! ' , just like
that . nobody came up , i hang up .
george : well , was it for costanza or ...
bruce : yes , yes , that 's it . nobody answered .
george : well was it a woman ?
bruce : yeah , yeah . i tell her you not here , she said curse word , i hang up .
( george comes over to jerry and elaine , stunned )
george : she called . he yelled cartwright . i missed her .
jerry : who 's cartwright ?
george : i 'm cartwright !
jerry : you 're not cartwri-
george : of course i 'm not cartwright ! look , why do n't you two just go to the
movies all by yourselves , i 'm not in the mood .
elaine : well me neither , i 'm goin ' to 'skyburger ' .
jerry : so you 're not going ?
elaine : you do n't need us .
jerry : well i ca n't go to a bad movie by myself . who am i gon na make sarcastic
remarks to , strangers ? eh , i guess i 'll just go to my uncle 's .
george : should we tell him we 're leaving ?
elaine : what for ? let 's just get out of here .
( they all leave )
bruce : seinfeld , 4 ?
( closing monologue )
jerry : hunger will make people do amazing things . i mean , the proof of that is
cannibalism . cannibalism , what do they say , i mean , they 're eating and , you
know , `` this is good , who is this ? i like this person '' . you know , i mean , i
would think the hardest thing about being a cannibal is trying to get some very
deep sleep , you know what i mean ? i would think , you 'd be like , ( pretending to
wake up ) `` who is that ? who 's there ? who 's there ? is somebody there ? what do
you want ? what do you want ? you look hungry , are you hungry ? get out of
here ! ''
( credits roll ; the end )
[ setting : night club ]
jerry : i 'm not a foodie . i do n't , `` oh , this is too rare . oh , it 's too salty . '' just eat it and shut up . i 'll eat anywhere , whatever they 're having . i have eaten rotten rolls
off of room service trays in hotel hallways . i have . it 's not a joke . this is my life . i do n't know , somebody left it . why would someone poison a roll , and leave it in a
hallway for some comic coming down at two o ' clock in the morning ? why would they do that ? sometimes you go to a nice restaurant , they put the check in a little
book . what is this ? the story of the bill ? `` once upon a time , there were some very hungry people .. '' what is this ? a little gold tassle hanging down ? am i graduating
from the restaurant ? what is this about ?
( scene ends )
[ setting : a restaurant ]
( jerry , george , and elaine are all eating at an italian restaurant . george has n't eaten anything )
elaine : do you want some of mine ?
jerry : take some of mine .
george : why do i get pesto ? why do i think i 'll like it ? i keep trying to like it , like i have to like it .
jerry : who said you have to like it ?
george : everybody likes pesto . you walk into a restaurant , that 's all you hear - pesto , pesto , pesto .
jerry : i do n't like pesto .
george : where was pesto 10 years ago ?
jerry : ( gesturing to a man ) look at that guy . ( elaine starts to look , but jerry stops her ) i 'll bet you he 's gettin ' hair transplants . any time you see a guy that age
wearing a baseball cap , ten to one - plugs .
elaine : ( elaine turns to look at the man , trying to make it sound like they are n't talking about him ) the thing about that painting .. is with the colors and um .. ( turns
back to jerry ) oh yeah , plugola .
( george has started eating elaine 's food - and continues to do so )
jerry : ( to elaine ) oh , one more thing about the car . let it warm up for a minute .
george : that 's a tough minute . it 's like waiting in the shower for the conditioner to work .
jerry : i do n't understand why he could n't take a cab .
george : who ?
jerry : elaine is having a `` houseguest . '' she 's picking him up at the airport tonight .
george : a guy ?
elaine : ( slightly embarrassed ) yes , a guy .
jerry : he 's from a .. yakima , right ?
elaine : seattle .
jerry : everybody 's moving to seattle .
george : it 's the pesto of cities . so .. ?
elaine : ( to jerry ) you tell him .
jerry : well , from what i can piece together , our friend here met a gentleman .
elaine : ed .
jerry : who was in town on a business venture , and um ..
elaine : .. we shared an interpersonal experience . ( george hits his glass with his fork . to jerry ) go on .
jerry : so they went out a few times , but apparently , when the fellow returned home , he discovered that the benes tattoo does not wash off so easily .
elaine : on some people .
george : oooh .
jerry : so , he 's coming in to stay with her for a week .
elaine : it was just gon na be a weekend , but then somehow it became a week .
( the menu at a neighboring table catches fire . elaine quickly picks up a wine glass - about to put it out , but george tosses the menu on the floor , and stomps it out .
the manager approaches )
manager : what happened ?
george : oh , the busboy left the menu a little close to the candle .
manager : sorry to the disturbance .
elaine : ( joking , she snobbishly says ) i 'm never eating here again .
( manager leaves )
jerry : ( pats george on the back ) nice going . thank you , that ought to get us a free dessert .. ( they can see the manager chewing the busboy out from the dining
room doorway ) i think the busboy 's in trouble .
george : did i get him in trouble ? because of what i said ? ! i just told him what happened .. he did n't do it on purpose .. ( mangager and busboy are arguing . the
busboy points in the direction of george ) he pointed at me . why did he point at me ? !
elaine : i said i would never eat here again .. but , i , i .. he had to know i was kidding .
jerry : ( casually buttering a roll , like he 's the innocent one ) i did n't say anything .
( the busboy takes of his apron , throws it down , and exits the restaurant )
george : i ca n't believe it . he 's going ! he 's fired !
elaine : oh , i said it in a kidding way .
george : i did n't know he 'd get fired .
jerry : ( jokingly trying to put more pressure on elaine and george ) he 'll probably kill his family over this .
george : what if he 's waiting for me outside ? he pointed at me ! did you see him point ? !
jerry : ( again , joking ) a lot of ex-cons become busboys . they seem to gravitate twards 'em .
george : was it my fault ?
elaine : was it my fault ?
jerry : ( does n't have a care in the world ) .. maybe i 'll try that pesto .
( scene ends )
[ setting : jerry 's apartment ]
jerry : look , i feel bad for him too , but he 'll get another job . i mean , let 's face it , it 's not a profession where you embellish your resume and undergo a series of
grueling interviews .
george : ( eating a sandwich ) oh , like you really know busboys .
jerry : oh , like you do .
george : hey , at least i was a camp waiter .
jerry : ( scoffing ) camp .
george : it was a fat camp . those kids depended on me .
( the intercom buzzes , jerry talks through it )
jerry : elaine ?
elaine : ( through intercom ) yeah .
( jerry pushes a button on the intercom - letting her in )
jerry : busboys are always changing jobs . that 's the business . i know . i work with these guys . i tallk to them in the kitchen at the comedy clubs .
george : then why do n't you try and get him another job ?
jerry : i 'd love to , but i do n't know anything about him . he could be one of those people that walks around the street pricking people with pins .
( elaine enters )
elaine : i do n't know if you people are aware of this , but i am one clever chickadee .
george : what ? did you get the busboy 's number ?
elaine : his phone 's been disconnected , but i was able to obtain an address - 1324 amsterdam avenue , apartment 4d . ( hands george a card ) now , i did my
job . ( to jerry ) may i have the car keys , please ?
( jerry hands the car keys to elaine )
george : how did you get all this ?
elaine : does the word `` charm '' mean anything to you ?
jerry : no . ( george grabs his jacket ) so now you 're going to his apartment ? i really think this is nuts .
george : ( putting his jacket on ) i 'd like to apologize . i want to tell him i .. i .. did n't mean to get him in trouble .
jerry : you , you 're going now ?
george : yeah , i want to see if there 's anything i can do .. maybe get him another job .. maybe i 'll hear of something .
jerry : maybe the fat camp . ( to elaine ) you 're not going ?
elaine : i would , but i have to pick up ed at the airport .
jerry : i just do n't think you should go alone . ca n't you wait till after my set ?
george : it 'll take to long .
( kramer enters )
jerry : take the k-man . a little support ..
george : ( unsure ) i do n't a ..
kramer : take me where ? where ?
( scene ends )
[ setting : an apartment building hallway ]
( george 's nervous - standing with kramer infront of the busboy 's apartment )
george : look , i really appreciate your coming , but if you would n't mind - try not to say too much .
kramer : what am i gon na say ?
george : i do n't know .
kramer : well , i 'm not an idiot .
george : certainly not .
kramer : then we 're cool .
george : yeah .. yeah , we 're - we 're cool . ( knocks lightly . kramer takes charge by knocking on the door louder . the busboy answers ) uh , i 'm sorry to bother
you , i was in the restaurant earlier and i was wondering if i could talk to you for a few minutes about what happened . ( he gestures for them to come in . they obey )
i hope i 'm not interrupting anything . it 's just that i think i may have - without realizing it - been responsible for getting you fired . ( nervously laughs ) and .. and .. and i
just want you to know that i did n't intend for that to happen .
kramer : ( patting george on the shoulder ) he 's a hell of a guy .
george : this is a guy i know .. kramer .
( antonio , the busboy , is watching them suspiciously )
kramer : habla espanol ?
george : ( to himself ) oh my god .
antonio : si .
kramer : como se dice .. waterbed ?
george : ( interrupting ) anyway , i just wanted to let you know i 'm really sorry that happened , and if i can help out in any way , i 'll certainly be glad to do that .
( pause ) well , i guess that 's about it .
kramer : you got anything to drink ? agua ?
george : oy uy uy .. ( antonio points to the sink ) we really should get going .
kramer : let me get a glass of water . ( heads tward the sink )
george : hurry up .
antonio : ( notices that his cat is missing ) pequita ? pequita ? ( starts to panic )
kramer : his cat 's gone .
antonio : ( notes the door was left wide open ) la puerta esta abierta . ( starts screaming ) la puerta esta abierta ! ( to kramer and george ) who left the door
open ? ( silence ) who left the door open ? ! ( kramer and george look at eachother ) come on , come on ! help me look ! ( all three head out the door to look )
( scene ends )
[ setting : antonio 's apartment ]
( all three sit in silence )
kramer : .. you know , cats run away all the time . you know , my aunt , she had a cat . ran away . showed up three years later .. you never know . they got things in
their brains where they remember where they 're from . unless , of course , somebody else starts feeding him . see , that 's what you got ta worry about .
george : ( gestures for kramer to shut up ) once again , antonio , i ca n't even begin to say how deeply , deeply sorry i am about everything . the job , the cat .. ( a
lamp breaks ) the lamp .
kramer : the wire was sticking out .. ( fits the two broken pieces together ) yeah .
george : ( hands antonio a card ) here 's my card . i 'm in real estate , so , if you 're ever looking for something bigger , something nicer .. ( antonio is staring at him ,
angered ) .. maybe not right now . anyway .. ( extends his hand for a handshake . antonio does n't move )
kramer : you oughta get that wire fixed . ( they go to leave ) i got the door . ( shuts the door , the broken lamp falls to the floor )
( scene ends )
[ setting : jerry 's apartment ]
jerry : ( on the phone ) george , stop worrying about this guy . it was n't your fault .. come on , he 's not stalking you .
( kramer enters )
kramer : hey .
jerry : ( to kramer ) hey . ( to george ) he does n't even know where you live .. who told you to give him your business card ? .. ( intercom buzzes ) that 's elaine .
( kramer buzzes her in . jerry talks into the phone ) kramer .. ( to kramer ) george wants to know when you want to look for the cat again .
kramer : it 's been a week . it 's up to the cat now .
jerry : ( into phone ) kramer says it 's up to the cat now . ( to kramer ) it 'll be on your conscience .
kramer : oh ? how do you figure ?
jerry : ( into phone ) how do you figure ? ( to kramer ) 'cause you 're the one who left the door open .
kramer : why was i in charge of closing the door ?
jerry : ( into phone ) why was he in charge of closing the door ? ( irritated at the phone message relay , to kramer ) 'cause you came in after him !
kramer : so !
jerry : ( into phone ) so ! ( to kramer - getting even more angry ) so , the last person in should close the door !
kramer : let me talk to him .
jerry : ( to kramer ) talk - call him from your house . ( elaine enters . kramer leaves . to phone ) he 's calling you now .. okay . ( hangs up )
elaine : ed 's downstairs . can i have the car keys ?
( jerry pitches her the keys as she goes some tward his bathroom )
jerry : no hello ?
elaine : got any asprin ? ( finds some ) hello . now , lookit , you guarantee this car will get me to the airport tomarrow ? no problems ?
jerry : guarantee ? .. hey , it 's a car .
elaine : because if there 's even the slightest chance of any problem at all , i do n't want to take it - because if i do n't get this guy on a plane to seattle and out of my
life , i 'm gon na kill him , and everyone who tries to stop me .
jerry : ( jokingly asking ) so , did you have a nice week together ?
elaine : i heard a little ping in the car last time . what was that ping ?
jerry : there 's no ping . why are you so wacky ?
elaine : jerry , you can not imagine how much i hate this guy .. and he has n't even done anything ! it 's the situation . he 's a wonderful guy , but i hate his guts !
jerry : so , you two been , uh ..
elaien : no ! i told him i 've been having my period for the last five days ! i 'm sleeping all squished over on the edge of my bed .. but , i 've only got fourteen hours to
go . nothing can go wrong now . i think i 've taken care of everything . i 've confirmed the plane reservation . i 've checked the weather ..
jerry : what 's your airport route ?
elaine : i 've got it all mapped out - i 'm taking the tunnel .
jerry : .. what about the van wyck ?
elaine : i spoke to a cab driver . for five bucks , he turned me on to the rockaway boulevard shortcut .
jerry : oooh .
elaine : now , lookit , this plane leaves at 10:15. we 're getting up at about eight . that gives us enough time , right ?
jerry : you still using that old alarm clock ?
elaien : oh , no , no . i bought a new one today . it 's got everything - it 's got everything ... if you oversleep more than ten minutes , a hand comes out and slaps you in
the face .
( scene ends )
[ setting : night club ]
jerry : flying does n't make me nervous - driving to the airport can make you very nervous because when you 're flying , when you 're getting on the plane , if you miss
that plane , there 's no alternative . on the ground , you have options . you have buses , you have taxis , you have trains . but , when you 're taking a flight , if you miss it ,
that 's it . no airline goes , `` well , you missed the flight , we do have a cannon leaving in about ten minutes . would you be interested in that ? it 's not a direct cannon ,
you have to change cannons after you land . '' ( imitates cannon operator ) `` i 'm sorry , where you goin ' ? chicago ? ( cranks the cannon ) oh , dallas ? alright , wait a
second .. ( cranks cannon to dallas ) dallas . that 's about dallas . texas , anyway . you should hit texas . are you ready ? make sure you get out of the net
immediately , because we shoot the luggage in right after you . ''

[ setting : jerry 's apartment ]
jerry : anywhere in the city ?
george : anywhere in the city - i 'll tell you the best public toilet .
jerry : okay .. fifty-fourth and sixth ?
george : sperry rand building . 14th floor , morgan apparel . mention my name - she 'll give you the key .
jerry : alright .. sixty-fifth and tenth .
george : ( scoffs ) are you kidding ? lincoln center . alice tully hall , the met . magnificent facilities .
( elaine enters . she 's still wearing her nightclothes under her coat . her hair is messed up . she 's been through quite an ordeal )
elaine : ( slow , as if remember a dream ) i never new i could drive like that . i was going faster than i 've ever gone before , and yet , it all seemed to be happening in
slow motion . i was seeing three and four moves ahead , weaving in and out of lanes like an olympic skier on a gold metal run . i knew i was challenging the very laws
of physics . at queens boulevard , i took the shoulder . at jewel avenue , i used the median . i had it . i was there .. and then .. i hit the van wyck . they say no one 's
ever beaten the van wyck , but gentlemen , i tell you this - i came as close as anyone ever has . and if it had n't been for that five-car-pile-up on rockaway
boulevard , that numbskull would be on a plane for seattle right now instead of looking for a parking space downstairs .
( kramer enters )
kramer : .. the busboy 's coming ! the busboy 's coming !
george : the busboy 's coming ?
jerry : you do n't mean here ?
kramer : yeah . i just buzzed him in . he 's on his way up ..
george : he 's coming up ? ! ( moves to the door ) i 'll check you out later .
jerry : where are you going ?
george : i 'm the one he wants ! he 's coming to settle the score .
jerry : ( trying to get george and kramer out ) no . you three all know each other . there 's no point in me getting involved at this stage of the game .
kramer : no , he 's not going to do anything . i guarantee it .
george : oh , the hell with it . let him kill me . i ..
( there 's a knock in the hallway )
kramer : antonio . in here !
( antonio enters )
george : ( nervous , his voice cracks ) hey , antonio . how 's it going ?
( antonio crosses over to george , and gives him a hug )
antonio : three nights ago , a gas main beneath the restaurant exploded , killing five people in my section , including the busboy who replaced me . if i am not fired
that night because of you and your thoughtless , stupid , insensitive remarks , it would have been me . you saved my life . ( hugs him again )
george : ( trying to be modest ) ah , come on ..
( the intercom buzzes )
elaine : ( into the intercom ) yeah ?
ed : it 's eddie .
elaine : he 's coming up . ( buzzes him in ) he 's coming up ..
antonio : and that very same night of the accident , while looking for pequita , i found a job in a restaurant where they pay me almost twice what i was making
before - and when i returned to the apartment , pequita , perhaps frightened from the explosion , had miraculously returned . well , but now , i must go , for today i am
starting my new and wonderful job . and i am very late . thank you , thank you , thank you all . ( leaves )
( everyone ad-libs congratulations to george . then , we hear a fight erupting from the hallway )
ed : hey , watch were you 're going . you almost knocked my head off !
antonio : hey , why do n't you watch where you 're going , okay ? 'cause you bumped into me !
ed : who do you think you 're talking to , pal ?
antonio : hey , get your hands off me !
ed : go to hell !
( antonio screams out profanity in spanish , then we hear them getting into a serious fight )
( scene ends )
[ setting : coffee shop ]
jerry : he 'll get another job . he 's a busboy !
george : it wo n't for a while . at least not until after the cast comes off .
jerry : it was that fall down the stairs . that 's what did it .
george : that 's not how it happened . it 's when he fell on him with his knee .
elaine : oh , that was awful . poor antonio . ( waiter hands elaine two bags of food to go ) .. thanks .
george : so , much longer ?
elaine : till when - till he goes back to seattle , or till he can feed himself ?
george : ( not wanting to make elaine mad ) i guess it 's not important .
elaine : take care of yourselves . ( leaves )
george : i should probably get going too . if i do n't feed pequita by seven , she goes all over everything .. take it easy .
jerry : yeah .. ( takes a bite of his sandwich as the waiter starts cleaning off the table ) how ya doing ?
( scene ends )
[ setting : night club ]
jerry : first of all , i ca n't believe that people actually do fight . people have fist fights in life . i ca n't really believe that we have boxing either . it 's really kind of an
amazing thing . to me , the problem with boxing is - you have two guys having a fight that have no prior argument . why do n't they have the boxers come into the ring
in little cars , drive around a bit , have a little accident ? they get out , `` did n't you see my signal ? '' `` look at that fender ! '' .. then you 'd see a real fight .
end of show .
every time somebody recommends a doctor , he 's always the best . `` oh , is he good ? '' `` oh , he 's the best . this guy 's the best . '' they ca n't all be the best . there ca n't be this many bests . someone 's graduating at the bottom of these classes , where are these doctors ? is somewhere , someone saying to their friend , '' you should see my doctor , he 's the worst . oh yeah , he 's the worst , he 's the absolute worst there is . whatever you 've got , it 'll be worse after you see him . he 's just , he 's a butcher . the man 's a butcher. '' ? and then there 's always that , `` make sure that you tell him that , you know , you know me . '' why ? what's the difference ? he 's a doctor . what is it , `` oh , you know bob ! okay , i 'll give you the real medicine . everybody else , i 'm giving tic-tacs . ''
first scene . jerry is getting a massage .
julianna : ... and usually for lunch i 'll have a salad , and for dinner , i eat whatever i want .
jerry : what do you think the worst part of being blind is ?
julianna : excuse me ?
jerry : you know , if you were blind what do you think the worst part of it would be ?
julianna : i do n't know .
jerry : i think it would be not being able to tell if there was bugs in my food . how could you ever enjoy a meal like that ? i 'd constantly be feeling around with my lips and my tongue .
julianna : well that 's how my five-year old eats . he 's a very picky eater .
jerry : you hear about that kid that was kidnapped the other day in pennsylvania ?
julianna : no .
jerry : he was at a carnival with his mother . she goes to get a hot dog , next thing you know she turns around , boom , he 's gone .
julianna : oh .
jerry : imagine how sick a person has to be to do something like that . and these people are all over the place . you never know who 's crazy , i could be one of these people .
julianna ( visibly uncomfortable ) : have you seen any good movies ?
jerry : who takes care of your boy during the day ?
julianna : we have a woman . why ?
jerry : no no . i 'm just saying .
julianna : she had references .
jerry : i 'm sure she did , i 'm sure they 're impeccable . i 'm talking about the ones that forge them . you know i think this is really helping .
julianna : i do n't live near here , ya know !

new scene . jerry , elaine and george are at jerry 's apartment .
jerry : so she 's giving me the massage and i 'm just making conversation .
elaine : i do n't like to talk during a massage .
jerry : neither do i , but i do it for them . i figure they 're bored .
george : yeah , i do that too . i feel guilty about getting the pleasure . i feel like i do n't deserve it so i talk . it stops me from enjoying it . there's nothing to eat in here .
elaine : oh ! i forgot to tell you --
jerry : i 'm in the middle of a story .
elaine : okay , go ahead .
george : why do n't you ever go shopping ?
jerry : not like it 's a really funny story or anything .
elaine : what happened ?
jerry : well so she mentioned that she had a son , and the for some reason i launch into the story about the kid from pennsylvania who was abducted .
elaine : oh , was n't that terrible ?
jerry : yes , it was .
george : not even an apple .
elaine : she does n't want to hear that , that was stupid .
jerry : i know it was stupid .
elaine : really stupid .
jerry : hey , i just said it was stupid .
george : what about this leftover chinese food ?
jerry : take it .
elaine : i ca n't believe you said that .
jerry : hey , would you stop it already ?
elaine : so , what did she say ?
jerry : i do n't know , she actually seemed to get a little paranoid .
george : this is terrible . what is this , ginger ? i hate ginger . i can't understand how anyone can eat ginger .
elaine : i have a good masseuse you could go to .
jerry : nah , she 's really good and she 's not just a masseuse , she 's a physical therapist . there 's a big difference . she uses the ultrasound , it 's a real medical procedure . in fact , if you get a doctor 's note , it 's covered by insurance .
george : physical therapy is covered by insurance ?
jerry : yeah .
george : you do n't have to pay for the massage ?
jerry : not if you have a doctor 's note .
elaine : so where do you get this note ?
jerry : well i 've never actually done it but if i really wanted to i could probably get one from my friend roy , the dentist .
george : right , your friend roy .
elaine : what 's the name of this physical therapist ?
jerry : i 'll tell you , but do n't ask her anything about her kid , she a little off .
george : and you do n't have to pay .
new scene . george and elaine are at the physical therapist 's office .
george : we have three-o'clock appointments .
receptionist : george and elaine , right ? could you fill these out for me please ? and elaine , you 'll be seeing julianna , and george , you 'll be with raymond .
george : excuse me , did you say 'raymond ' ?
receptionist : yes .
george : but , uh , raymond is a man .
receptionist : that 's right .
george sits down slowly , letting this sink in .
george : i ca n't get a massage from a man .
elaine : why not ?
george : what , are you crazy ? i ca n't have a man touching me . switch with me .
elaine : no , i do n't want the man either .
george : what 's the difference , you 're a woman . they 're supposed to be touching you .
elaine : he 'd just be touching your back .
george : he 'd just be touching your back too .
elaine : no , it could get sexual .
george : i know . that 's the point . if it 's gon na get sexual , it should get sexual with you .
elaine : i would n't be comfortable .
george : i would ? what if something happens ?
elaine : what could happen ?
george : what if it felt good ?
elaine : it 's supposed to feel good .
george : i do n't want it to feel good .

george : really .
raymond : i used to be a flight attendant .
george : oh boy .
raymond : ya know , why do n't you open those pants , it 's gon na be a lot easier that way .
george loosens his pants , raymond grabs them and yanks then down his hips then starts massaging his lower back .
raymond : so what do you do ?
george : what ?
raymond : i said , 'what do you do ? ' .
george : i do n't know .
raymond : you do n't know what you do ?
george : nah .
raymond : oh , come on . hey , you 're very tense .

raymond : but you wrote that it was tender .
george : i wrote . pfft , * i * wrote .
raymond : i 'll check it out .
george : are you sure ?
raymond : yeah , take 'em off .
george gets up to remove his pants , he looks over and sees raymond rubbing his hands with oil . nervous , george pulls his pants down and climbs back on the table . as soon as raymond touches his leg , george becomes rigid with discomfort .
raymond : how did you hurt this ?
george : i do n't know .
raymond : you do n't know ?
george : no .
raymond : but you just told me --

jerry : moved ?
george : it may have moved , i do n't know .
jerry : i 'm sure it did n't move .
george : it moved ! it was imperceptible but i felt it .
jerry : maybe it just wanted to change positions ? you know , shift to the other side .
george : no , no . it was n't a shift , i 've shifted , this was a move .
jerry : okay , so what if it moved ?
george : that 's the sign ! the test ; if a man makes it move .
jerry : that 's not the test . contact is the test , if it moves as a result of contact .
george : you think it 's contact ? it has to be touched ?
jerry : that 's what a gym teacher once told me .

kramer : well maybe he likes dinky donuts .
george : i do n't even like to sit next to a man on an airplane 'cause our knees might touch .
jerry : i ca n't see joe dimaggio sitting at the counter in little tiny filthy smelly dinky donuts .
kramer : why ca n't joe dimaggio have a donut like everyone else ?
jerry : he can have a donut , but not at dinky .
george : i do n't even like to use urinals , i 've always been a stall man .
kramer : look i 'm telling -- ( he does a double take and looks at george ) i'm telling you , that was joe dimaggio .
george : the guy slept with marilyn monroe , he 's in dinky donuts . what about this doctor 's note ? let 's go see your friend roy .
jerry : i never said i 'd do that .
george : what are you talking about , that 's seventy-five bucks ! i 'm not working , i ca n't afford that .
jerry : i do n't know how i feel about it .
george : oh , what are you , like , a quaker now ?
jerry : alright , alright .
kramer : a stall man , huh ?
new scene . george and jerry are in roy 's office .

jerry : well what about the week after ? no appointments at all ? ( jerry tries to sit down on the couch , but elaine is too close to the end and he has to squeeze in between her and the arm to sit down ) can i at least just talk to her so i can apologize ? forget it . ( hangs up ) i ca n't believe this , i make one innocent comment about some lunatic in pennsylvania and i 'm cut off . this woman is insane . ( looks at elaine for a moment ) what 's with you ?

kramer : that 's right .
jerry : see , now i know it 's not him . joe dimaggio could not be a dunker .
kramer : oh , he 's a dunker .
elaine : why could n't he be a dunker ?

elaine : so then what ?
kramer : well , then the waitress , she comes up and she tells me to shut up or they 're gon na throw me out .
elaine : why did n't you just call out his name ?
george enters , his pants are ripped at the knee .

jerry : -- but , you see , let me just talk to you for a second , see , what i did is inadvertently sent an insurance --
julianna : i treated you , so please , just get out of the office !

kramer : wait , wait . * bang * ( he slams his hand down on the table ) * bang * ( again ) * yip * ( another high pitched yelping sound ) * yip * see ? i told you .
closing monologue .
what causes homophobia ? what is it that makes a heterosexual man worry ? i think it 's because men know that deep down we have weak sales resistance . we're constantly buying shoes that hurt us , pants that do n't fit right . men think , '' obviously i can be talked into anything . what if i accidentally wander into some sort of homosexual store , thinking it 's a shoe store , and the salesman goes , 'just hold this guy 's hand , walk around the store a little bit , see how you feel . no obligation , no pressure , just try it . would you like to see him in a sandal ? ' ''
welcome everyone to the room ... ah , the extra button .... yeah ... what kind of a sicko
would save these ... have them in a huge file , drawers that wide ( small fingers opening
imaginary drawers ) where the hell is that ... i mean is it that hard to get round black
buttons that they have to make it into such a great thing like this ? ... is it such a
great jacket ... the buttons are so unique , so one of a kind , you 'll never find them - they
save you the trouble of knocking your brain off - and we know they 're going to fall off
too that 's the other thing ...

feel it gives me something , i know i 'm naked , but you know , < <UNK> and

=========
i was audited last year . at first i thought well , irs kinda sounds like toys <UNK>
us maybe wo n't be so bad . maybe they have a sense of fun about it , you know .
but it 's it 's bad . it 's an ordeal . and they do n't do anything to keep your
<UNK> up through the ordeal . i think they should take all your receipts and
put them in one of those big <UNK> <UNK> and just kinda <UNK> it around
there . you know give me a feeling like you might win something . you know what i
mean ? then they can pull them out one by one and go `` oh , i 'm sorry that 's
another illegal <UNK> . but we do have some lovely <UNK> gifts for you .
jail ! ''

i had a parakeet when i was a kid , that was the only pet that i really enjoyed . we used to let him out of his cage , and he would fly around and my mother had built , one entire wall of our living room was <UNK> . she felt this gives you a feeling of space . have you ever heard this <UNK> design <UNK> that a mirror makes it seem like you have an entire other room ? what kind of a jerk walks up to a mirror and goes , `` hey look , there 's a whole <UNK> room in there . there 's a guy in there looks just like me . '' but the parakeet will fall for this , you 'll let him out of his cage , he flies around the room , bang ! with his little head , he would just go <UNK> ' ohh ! and i 'd always think , even if he thinks the mirror is another room , why does n't he at least try to avoid hitting the other parakeet ?

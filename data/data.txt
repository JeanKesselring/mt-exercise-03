[Setting: Nightclub]

JERRY: I'm always in traffic with the lane expert. You know this type of person? Constantly reevaluating their lane choice.. Never quite sure, "Is this the best lane for

me? For my life?" They're always a little bit ahead of you, "Can I get in over there? Could I get in over here? Could I get in there?" "Yeah, come on over here, pal.

We're zoomin' over here. This is the secret lane, nobody knows about it.." The ultimate, I think the ultimate psychological test of traffic is the total dead stop. Not

even rolling. And you look out the window, you can see gum clearly. So we know that in the future traffic will get even worse than that. I mean, what will happen?

Will it start moving backwords, I wonder? I mean, is that possible? That someday we'll be going "Boy, this is some really bad traffic now, boy. This, is really bad.

I'm gonna try to get off and get back on going the other way."

[Setting: Jerry's car]

GEORGE: She can't kill me right?!

JERRY: No, of course not.

GEORGE: People break up all the time.

JERRY: Everyday.

GEORGE: It just didn't work out. What can I do? I wanted to love her. I tried to love her. I couldn't.

JERRY: You tried.

GEORGE: I kept looking at her face. I'd go: "C'mon, love her. Love her!"

JERRY: Did you tell her you loved her?

GEORGE: Oh, I had no choice. She squeezed it out of me! She'd tell me she loved me. Alright, at first, I just look at her. I'd go "Oh, really?" or "Boy, that's, that's

something." But, eventually you have to come back with "Well, I love you." You know, you can only hold out for so long!"

JERRY: You're a human being.

GEORGE: And I didn't even ask her out. She asked me out first. She called me up. What was I supposed to do? Say no? I can't do that to someone.

JERRY: You're too nice a guy.

GEORGE: I am. I'm a nice guy.. (realizing) And she seduced me! We were in my apartment, I'm sitting on the couch, she's on the chair - I get up to go to the

bathroom, I come back, she's on the couch. What am I supposed to do? Not do anything? I couldn't do that. I would've insulted her.

JERRY: You're flesh and blood.

GEORGE: I had nothing to do wtih any of this! I met all her friends, I didn't want to meet them. I kept trying to avoid it. I knew it would only get me in deeper. But

they were everywhere! They kept popping up, all over the place. "This is Nancy, this is Susan, this is Amy.. This is my cousin.. this is my brother.. thisis my father."

It's like I'm in quicksand.

JERRY: I told you when I met her..

GEORGE: My back is killing me.

JERRY: You gotta go to my chiropractor, he's the best.

GEORGE: Oh yeah, everybody's guy is the best.

JERRY: I'm gonna make an appointment for you. We'll go together.

GEORGE: Please. They don't do anything.. Look, do I have to break up with her in person? CAn't I do it over the phone? I have no stomach for these things.

JERRY: You should just do it like a Band-Aid. One motion! Right off!

(Car door opens, it's Elaine)

ELAINE: Hi.

JERRY: Hi.

(George pulls his seat forward to allow Elaine into the back seats)

ELAINE: Hey, what are you doing?

GEORGE: I'm letting you in.

ELAINE: Oh no. No. I don't want to sit in the back. I'll be left out of the conversation.

GEORGE: No, you won't.

ELAINE: Yes, I will, George. I'll have to sick my chin on top of the seat.

GEORGE: Okay..

(George gets out, and gestures for Elaine to sit in the seat)

ELAINE: Why can't you sit in the middle?

GEORGE: Please, it doesn't look good. Boy, boy, girl.

ELAINE: I think you're afraid to sit next to a man. You're a little homophobic, aren't you?

GEORGE: Is it that obvious?

(Elaine sits in the middle)

ELAINE: Hello, Jerry.

JERRY: Hello.

ELAINE: Did you get a haircut?

JERRY: No, shower. So, where are we eating?

ELAINE: Tell me if you think this is strange: There's this guy who lives in my building, who I was introduced to a couple of years ago by a friend. He's a teacher, or

something. Anyway, after we met, whenever we'd run into each other on the street, or in the lobby, or whatever, we would stop and we would chat a little.. Nothing

much. Little pleasantries. He was a nice guy, he's got a family.. then after a while, I noticed there was not more stopping. Just saying hello and continuing on our way.

And then the verbal hellos stopped, and we just went into these little sort of nods of recognition. So, fine. I figure, that's where this relationship is finally gonna settle:

polite nodding. Then one day, he doesn't nod. Like I don't exist?! He went from nods to nothing.

GEORGE: (imitating Tony Bennett) "You know, I'd go from nods to nothing.."

ELAINE: And now, there's this intense animosity whenever we passs. I mean, it's like we really hate each other. It's based on nothing.

JERRY: A relationship is an organism. You created this thing and then you starved it so it turned against you. Same thing happened to The Blob.

GEORGE: I think you absolutely have to say something to this guy. Confront him.

ELAINE: Really?

GEORGE: Yes.

ELAINE: You would do that?

GEORGE: If I was a different person.

(Scene ends)

[Setting: Jerry's apartment; Jerry's on the phone]

JERRY: Hello.. hello. Is Glenn there? I'm sorry. Is this 805-555-3234?.. Yes, I know I have the wrong number. But I just want to know if I dialed wrong or if..

(Other guy hangs up on Jerry; he redials; enter Kramer)

(The buzzer buzzes; Kramer answers it)

KRAMER: Come on up.

JERRY: (Into phone) Oh, it's you again. See? Now if you had answered me, I wouldn't have had to do this. Now that's too long distance calls I made to you why

can't you.. (guy hangs up on Jerry again). (To Kramer) Why? Why do they just hang up like that?! Thank you very much.

(Kramer holds up cantaloupe)

KRAMER: Taste this.

JERRY: No, I just had a sandwich.

KRAMER: No, taste it. Taste it.

JERRY: I don't want cantaloupe now.

KRAMER: You've never had cantaloupe like this before.

JERRY: I only eat cantaloupe at certain times.

KRAMER: Jerry. This is great cantaloupe.

JERRY: Alright.. (tastes it)

KRAMER: Ah, huh. It's good?

JERRY: It's very good.

KRAMER: Good, huh?

JERRY: Good.

KRAMER: I got it at Joe's.

JERRY: Uh-Huh.

KRAMER: Forty-nine cents a pound. That's practically half than what you're paying at the supermarket. I don't know why you don't go to Joe's.

JERRY: It's too far.

KRAMER: It's three blocks further. You can use my shopping cart..

JERRY: I'm not pulling a shopping cart. What am I suppose to wear? A kerchief? Put stockings on and roll 'em down below my knee?

KRAMER: See, the other thing is, if you don't like anything, he takes it right back.

JERRY: I don't return fruit. Fruit is a gamble. I know that going in.

(Enter George; he's extremely excited - he's dancing around the room, singing the Zorba theme)

GEORGE: I'm outta there. I did it! It's over.

JERRY: You did it? What happened?

GEORGE: I told her. In the kitchen - which was risky 'cause it's near all the knives. I started with the word "Listen."

JERRY: Ah ha.

GEORGE: I said, "Listen Marlene," and then the next thing I know, I'm in the middle of it. And there's this voice inside of me going: "You're doing it! You're doing

it!" And then she started to cry, and I weakened a bit. I almost relented, but the voice, Jerry. The voice said "Keep going, keep going. You're almost out!" It's like I

was making a prison break, you know. And I'm heading for the wall, and I trip and I twist my ankle, and they throw the light on you, you know. So, somehow I get

though the crying and I keep running. Then the cursing started. She's firing at me from the guard tower: "Son of a bang! Son of a boom!" I get to the top of the wall -

the front door. I opened it up, I'm one foot away, I took one last look around the penitentiary, and I jumped!

JERRY: See, it's never as bad as you imagine.

KRAMER: I liked Marlene. What's her number?

GEORGE: No, I, I don't think so.

(Kramer stants making noises while eating)

JERRY: Could you stop that smacking?

KRAMER: George, I want you to taste this cantaloupe.

GEORGE: Oh no, thank you.

KRAMER: It's the best cantaloupe I ever had.

GEORGE: No, really. No, no, thanks.

KRAMER: Jerry, tell him how good this cantaloupe is.

JERRY: It's very good cantaloupe. (changing subject) So that's it? You're out?

GEORGE: Except for one small problem. I left some books in her apartment.

JERRY: So, go get them.

GEORGE: Oh, no. No, I can't go back there. Jerry, it's so awkward and, you know, it could be dangerous - sexually. Something could happen, I'd be right back

where I started.

JERRY: So forget about the books. Did you read them?

GEORGE: Well, yeah.

JERRY: What do you need them for?

GEORGE: I don't know. They're books.

JERRY: What is this obsession people have with books? They put them in their houses - like they're trophies. What do you need it for after you read it?

GEORGE: They're MY books.

JERRY: So you want me to get those books? Is that it?

(Scene ends)

[Setting: Coffee Shop]

(Jerry and Marlene are sitting, a pile of books are on the table.)

MARLENE: ..So, it must've been ninety-five degrees that night, and everyone's just standing around the pool with little drinks in their hands. I was wearing my old

jeans and T-shirt. And I don't know, I was just in one of those moods - so I said to myself, "Marlene, just do it," and I jumped in. And as I'm getting out, I feel all

these eyes on me, and I look up and everyone is just staring at me.

JERRY: So what'd you do?

MARLENE: Well, nothing. It's not skin off my hide if people like to look. I just didn't see what the big attraction was.

JERRY: Well, I have a general idea what it was. I could take a guess.

MARLENE: (Laughs) Hey, you know, Jerry, just because George and I don't see each other anymore, it doesn't mean we shouldn't stay friends.

JERRY: No.

MARLENE: Good enough. I'm really glad we got that settled.

(Scene ends)

[Setting: Chiropractor waiting room]

JERRY: (Irritated) I don't know how this happened.

GEORGE: Jerry, it's not my fault.

JERRY: No, no. It's not your fault. Books, books, I need my books. Have you re-read those books yet, by the way? You know the great thing? When you read

Moby Dick the second time, Ahab and the whale become good friends. You know, it's not like Marlene's a bad person or anything, but, my God! I mean, we've

had like three lunches and a movie. And she never stops calling. (George nods - he knows exactly what Jerry's talking about) And it's these meaningless,

purposeless, blather calls. She never asks if I'm busy or anything. I just pick up the phone and she's in the middle of a sentence.

GEORGE: That's standard. Has she left you one of those messages where she uses up the whole machine?

JERRY: Ohh.. you know, and sometimes she'll go, "Hello, Jerry?" and I'll go "Oh, hi Marlene." And then it's "Jerry.."

GEORGE: What about getting off the phone?

JERRY: Ohhhh.. you can't. It's impossible. There's no break in the conversation where you can go, "Alright, then.. " You know, it just goes on and on and on with

out a break in the wall. I mean, I gotta put a stop to this.

GEORGE: Just do it like a Band-Aid. One motion, right off! She is sexy though. Don't you think?

JERRY: Yeah. Yes, she is.

(Receptionist enters)

RECEPTIONIST: Mr. Costanza?

GEORGE: Yeah.

RECEPTIONIST: The doctor'll see you now.

GEORGE: (To Jerry, sarcastically) Yeah, doctor. I'm going to have to wait in that little room by myself, aren't I? (Picks up a crossword puzzle) I better take this. I

hate the little room. "Oh, hello, Doctor."

(Scene ends)

[Setting: Night club]

JERRY: Waiting room. I hate when they make you wait in the room. 'Cause it says "Waiting room." There's no chance of not waiting, 'cause they call it the waiting

room, they're going to use it. They've got it. It's all set up for you to wait. And you sit there, you know, and you've got your little magazine. You pretend you're

reading it, but you're really looking at the other people. You know, you're thinking about about them things like "I wonder what he's got. As soon as she goes, I'm

getting her magazine." And then, they finally call you and it's a very exciting moment. They finally call you, and you stand up and you kinda look around at the other

people in the room. "Well, I guess I've been chosen. I'll see you all later." You know, so you think you're going to see the doctor, but you're not, are you? No.

You're going into the next waiting room. The littler waiting room. But if they are, you know, doing some sort of medical thing to you, you want to be in the smallest

room that they have, I think. You don't wnat to be in the largest room that they have. You know what I mean? You ever see these operating theaters, that they have,

with like, stadium seating? You don't want them doing antying to you that makes other doctors go, "I have to see this!" "Are you kidding? Are they really gonna do

that to him?" "Are there seats? Can we get in?" Do they scalp tickets to these things? "I got two for the Winslow tumor, I got two.."

(Scene ends)

[Setting: Waiting room]

(George returns)

JERRY: So, how was it?

GEORGE: I was in there for two minutes. He didn't do anything. (Imitating doctor) Touch this, feel that. Seventy-five bucks.

JERRY: Well, it's a first visit.

GEORGE: What's seventy-five bucks? What, am I seeing Sinatra in there?! Amd I being entertained? I don't understand this. I'm only paying half.

JERRY: You can't do that.

GEORGE: Why not?

JERRY: He's a doctor. You gotta pay what he says.

GEORGE: Oh, no, no, no. I pay what I say.

(Scene ends)

[Setting: Jerry's car]

MARLENE: Are you feeling weird?

JERRY: No, I'm fine.

MARLENE: Nothing really happened.

JERRY: Yeah, I know.

MARLENE: We just kissed a little. People kiss.

JERRY: Yeah.

MARLENE: Well.. night.

(Leans over and kisses Jerry)

JERRY: Good night.

(Scene ends)

[Setting: Jerry's apartment]

(Kramer enters with a golf club)

KRAMER: Hey.

JERRY: Hey.

KRAMER: I got it! This time, I got it!

JERRY: Alright.

KRAMER: Hips! See, it's all hips.

JERRY: Uh-huh.

KRAMER: You gotta come through with the hips first. (Demonstrates)

JERRY: That is out there.

(Kramer notices Jerry's eating cantaloupe, his eyes light up)

KRAMER: Joe's?

JERRY: No, supermarket.

KRAMER: Well, is it good?

JERRY: It's okay.

KRAMER: Let me taste it. (Takes a bite, spits it out) See, that stinks. You can't eat that. You should take it back.

JERRY: I'm not taking it back.

KRAMER: Alright, I'll take it back. I'm going by there.

JERRY: I don't care about it.

KRAMER: Jerry, you should care. Cantaloupe like this should be taken out of circulation.

JERRY: Alright. Take it back.

(Phone rings, Jerry is reluctant to answer it)

JERRY: (On his answering machine) Leave a message, I'll call you back.

MARLENE: (Leaving a message) Jerry, have you ever taken a bath in the dark? If I'm not talking into the soap right now, call me back.

KRAMER: Well?

JERRY: Marlene

KRAMER: (Smiles) Oh. Oh, Marlene.

JERRY: Yeah, I took her home one night - we kinda started up a little bit in the car.

KRAMER: I thought you were trying to get rid of her?

JERRY: I was. She's got me, like, hypnotized.

KRAMER: Does George know?

JERRY: No, he'd go nuts.

KRAMER: Yeah, no kidding.

JERRY: I feel terrible. (Kramer smiles) I mean, I've seen her a couple of times since then, and I know I can't go any further, but.. I've just got this like,

psycho-sexual hold over me. I just want her, I can't breathe. It's like a drug.

KRAMER: Woah, psycho-sexual.

JERRY: I don't know how I'm going to tell him.

KRAMER: Man, I don't understand people. I mean, why would George want to deprive you of pleasure? Is it just me?

JERRY: It's partially you, yeah.

KRAMER: You're his friend. Better that she should sleep with someone else. Some jerk that he doesn't even know.

JERRY: Well, he can't kill me, right?

KRAMER: You're a human being.

JERRY: I mean, she called me. I haven't called her. She started it.

KRAMER: You're flesh and blood.

JERRY: I'm a nice guy.

(Enter Elaine, she's holding a lamp)

ELAINE: Hi. (Hands Jerry the lamp)

JERRY: Oh, my little airplane lamp.

ELAINE: You know, you have the slowest elevator in the entire city? That's hard to get used to when you're in so many other fast ones.

JERRY: Well, the apartment elevators are always slower than the offices, because you don't have to be home on time.

ELAINE: Unless you're married to a dictator..

JERRY: Yeah.. because they would be very demanding people.

ELAINE: Right. Exactly. So I imagine at some point, somebody's going to offer me some cantaloupe.

KRAMER: Nope. No good.

JERRY: Well, you know what they say: Luck in love, Unlucky with fruit.

KRAMER: Well, I'm taking this back. (Leaves)

ELAINE: So, I had what you might call a little encounter this morning.

JERRY: Really? That guy who stopped saying hello?

ELAINE: Yep.

JERRY: You talked to him?

ELAINE: Yep. I spotted him getting his mail. And at first, I was just going to walk on by, but then I thought "no, no, no, no. Do not be afraid of this man."

JERRY: Right.

ELAINE: So, I walked up behind him and I tapped him on the shoulder. And I said, "Hi, remember me?" And he furrows his brow as if he's really trying to figure it

out. So I said to him, I said, "You little phony. You know exactly who I am."

JERRY: "You little phony"?

ELAINE: I did. I most certainly did. And he said, he goes, "Oh, yeah. You're Jeanette's friend. We did meet once." And I said, "Well, how do you go from that to

totally ignoring a person when they walk by?"

JERRY: Amazing.

ELAINE: And he says, he says, "Look, I just didn't want to say hello anymore, alright?" And I said, "Fine. Fine I didn't want to say hello anymore either, but I

wanted you to know that I'm aware of it."

(Elaine tastes some cantaloupe)

JERRY: You are the Queen of Confrontation. You're my new hero. In fact, you've inspired me. I'm gonna call George about something right now.

ELAINE: This cantaloupe stinks. (Spits it out)

(Scene ends)

[Setting: Coffee Shop]

GEORGE: I don't care.

JERRY: You're kidding.

GEORGE: No, I don't care.

JERRY: You mean that?

GEORGE: Absolutely.

JERRY: You don't care?

GEORGE: No.

JERRY: How could you not care?

GEORGE: I don't know. But I don't. I'm actually almost happy to hear it.

JERRY: I thought you'd be upset.

GEORGE: I guess I should be but I'm not.

JERRY: Am I a bad person? Did I do something terrible?

GEORGE: No, you're a fine person. You're a humanitarian. She's very sexy.

JERRY: That voice. That voice. She's driving me crazy.

GEORGE: I know, I know.

JERRY: So I can see her tonight, and you don't care?

GEORGE: See her tonight. See her tomarrow. Go. Knock yourself out. She's too crazy for me.

JERRY: Alright. As long as you're okay. Because I can't stop thinking about her.

GEORGE: I'm okay. I'm fine. I'm wonderful. I never felt better in my whole life.

JERRY: Good. And I'll tell you what.. You don't have to pay me back the thirty-five I gave to the chiropractor for the rest of your bill.

GEORGE: (Angry) You paid that crook?!

JERRY: I had to.

GEORGE: He didn't do anything, Jerry. It's a scam! Who told you to do that?

JERRY: It was embarrassing to me.

GEORGE: I was trying to make a point.

JERRY: Why don't you make a point with your own doctor? (George gulps) What's wrong?

GEORGE: (Gasping) I think I swallowed a fly! ..I swallowed a fly! What do I do? What can happen?

(Scene ends)

[Setting: Jerry's car]

JERRY: ..So, you want to come up for a few minutes?

MARLENE: ..I'm sorry, Jerry. I just don't think this is going to work.

JERRY: Really? I thought..

MARLENE: I know, I'm sorry.

JERRY: I guess I just didn't expect it from the way you've been acting.

MARLENE: You sure you want to talk about this? 'Cause I sure don't.

JERRY: Of course I want to talk about it.

MARLENE: Well, okay. I guess things changed for me on Tuesday night.

JERRY: Tuesday night? What happened Tuesday night?

MARLENE: ..I saw your act.

JERRY: My act? What does that have to do with anything?

MARLENE: Well, to be honest, it just didn't make it for me. It's just so much fluff.

JERRY: I can't believe this. So what are you saying? You didn't like my act, so that's it?

MARLENE: I can't be with someone if I don't respect what they do.

JERRY: You're a cashier!

MARLENE: Look, Jerry, it's just not my kind of humor.

JERRY: You can't go by the audience that night. It was late. They were terrible.

MARLENE: I heard the material.

JERRY: I have other stuff. You should come see me on the weekend.

(Scene ends)

[Setting: Night club]

JERRY: Women need to like the job of the guy they're with. If they don't like the job, they don't like the guy. Men know this. Which is why we make up the phony

bogus names for the jobs that we have. "Well, right now, I'm the regional management supervisor." "I'm in development, research, consulting." Men on the other

hand, if they are physically attracted to a woman are not that concerned with her job. Are we? Men don't really care. Men'll just go, "Really? Slaughterhouse? Is that

were you work? That sounds interesting. So whatdya got a big cleaver there? You're just lopping their heads off? That sounds great! Listen, why don't you shower

up, and we'll get some burgers and catch a movie."

[Setting: Night club]

JERRY: My parents live in Florida now. They moved there last year. They didn't want to move to Floriday, but they're in their sixties, and that's the law. You know

how it works. They got the leisure police. They pull up in front of the old people's house with a golf cart, jump out, "Let's go Pop, white belt, white pants, white

shoes, get in the back. Drop the snow shovel right there, drop it!" I am not much for the family gathering. You know, you sit there, and the conversation's so boring.

It's so dull. And you start to fantasize. You know, you think, what if I just got up and jumped out that window? What would it be like? Just crashed right through the

glass.. You know. Come back in, there's broken glass, everybody's all upset. "No, I'm alright. I was just a little bored, there. No, I'm fine. I came back. I wanted to

hear a little about that Hummel collection, Aunt Rose. Let's pick it up right there."

[Setting: Jerry's apartment]

(Jerry's parents are in town. His father's watching T.V., his mother is ironing his father's jackets)

HELEN: (To Morty) You have so many nice jackets. I don't know why you had to bring this jacket. Who wears a jacket like this? (He doesn't respond) What's

wrong with that nice gray one? You have beautiful clothes. They sit in your closet. Morty, you can't wear - this!

(Phone rings)

MORTY: Are you getting that?

HELEN: I thought you were getting it.

MORTY: Should I pick up?

HELEN: You want me to get that?

MORTY: I'll get it!

HELEN: I'll get it!

(They both go for the phone, Helen gets to it first)

HELEN: Hello?.. Hello?

(She hangs up. Jerry enters - he's wearing baseball clothes and carrying a bat and glove)

JERRY: (Talking about the loud T.V.) Would you make this thing lower! I can hear it on the street! (Turns it off)

MORTY: So, how'd you do?

JERRY: We won. I made an incredible play in the field! There was a tag-up at third base and I threw the guy out from left field on a fly! We'll be in the championship

game Wednesday because of me. It was the single greatest moment of my life.

HELEN: This is your greatest moment? A game?

JERRY: Well, no. Sharon Besser, of course.

MORTY: You know what my greatest moment was, don't you? 1946. I went to work for Harry Flemming and I came up with the idea for the beltless trench coat.

HELEN: Jerry, look at this sport jacket. Is this a jacket to wear to an anniversary party?

JERRY: Well, the man's an individualist. He worked for Harry Flemming. He knows what he's doing.

HELEN: But it's their 50th anniversary.

MORTY: You know, I spoke to Manya and Isaac on the phone today. They invited you again. I think you should go.

JERRY: First of all, I made plans with Elaine.

HELEN: So bring her.

JERRY: I don't even know them. What is she, your second cousin? I mean, I've met them three times in my life.

MORTY: I don't know her either. (Gesturing to Helen) She makes me fly all the way from Floriday for this, and then she criticizes my jacket.

HELEN: At least come and say hello, have a cup of coffee, then you'll leave.

MORTY: How come he gets to leave?

JERRY: If I wind up sitting nest to Uncle Leo, I am leaving. He's always grabbing my arm when he talks to me. I guess it's because so many people have left in the

middle of his conversation.

MORTY: And it's always about Jeffrey, right?

JERRY: Hey, he talks about him like he split the atom. The kid works for the Parks Department.

(Enter Kramer)

KRAMER: Morty, are you coming in?

MORTY: Oh, yeah. I forgot all about it.

KRAMER: (To Jerry) Hey, how'd you do?

JERRY: We won. We're in the finals on Wednesday..

KRAMER: Yeah!

JERRY: (To Kramer and Morty) What is this about?

KRAMER: I'm completely changing the configuration of the apartment. You're not gonna believe it when you see it. A whole new lifestyle.

JERRY: What are you doing?

KRAMER: Levels.

JERRY: Levels?

KRAMER: Yeah, I'm getting rid of all my furniture. All of it. And I'm going to build these different levels, with steps, and it'll all be carpeted with a lot of pillows. You

know, like ancient Egypt.

JERRY: You drew up plans for this?

KRAMER: No, no. It's all in my head.

MORTY: I don't know how you're going to be comfortable like that.

KRAMER: Oh, I'll be comfortable.

JERRY: When do you intend to do this?

KRAMER: Ohh.. should be done by the end of the month.

JERRY: You're doing this yourself?

KRAMER: It's a simple job. Why, you don't think I can?

JERRY: Oh, no. It's not that I don't think you can. I know that you can't, and I'm positive that you won't.

KRAMER: Well, I got the tools. I got the pillows. All I need is the lumber.

MORTY: Hey, that's some big job.

JERRY: I don't see it happening.

KRAMER: Well, this time, this time you're wrong. C'mon. I'll even bet you.

JERRY: Seriously?

HELEN: I dont' want you betting. Morty, don't let him bet.

KRAMER: A big dinner with dessert. But I've got till the end of the month.

JERRY: I'll give you a year.

KRAMER: No, no, no. End of the month.

JERRY: It's a bet. (They both "pinkie swear" to lock the deal)

(Scene ends)

[Setting: Manya's apartment]

(Jerry sits between Uncle Leo and Elaine. Leo grabs his choulder)

JERRY: Seriously, do you wnat to switch chairs?

ELAINE: No, no. I'm fine.

LEO: Jerry, are you listening to this?

JERRY: Yeah, Uncle Leo.

LEO: So, so, now the parks commissioner is recommending Jeffrey for a citation.

JERRY: Right. For reducing the pond scum?

LEO: No, for the walking tours.

JERRY: Oh, yeah. Where the people eat the plant life - the edible foliage tour.

LEO: That's exactly right. He knows the whole history of the park. For two hours he's talking and answering questions. But you want to know something? Whenever

he has a problem with one of these high-powered big shots in the Parks Department, you know who he calls?

JERRY: Mickey Mantle?

ELAINE: (Helping him worm out of the conversation with Leo) Jerry, Jerry. Did you taste these peas? These peas are great!

JERRY: (Eating a forkful) These peas are bursting with country-fresh flavor.

ELAINE: Mmm.. phenomenal peas..

MORTY: Are you ready for dessert?

JERRY: Well, actually, we do have to kind of get going.

MANYA: (Surprised) You're going?

ELAINE: I don't really eat dessert. I'm dieting.

JERRY: Yeah, I can't eat dessert either. The sugar makes my ankles swell up, and I can't dance.

MANYA: Can't dance?

HELEN: He's kidding, Manya.

MANYA: Is that a joke?

HELEN: (Canging subject) So, did you hear Claire's getting married?

MANYA: Yeah, yeah..

HELEN: I hear the fella owns a couple of racehorses. You know, trotters, like at Yonkers.

JERRY: Horses. They're like big riding dogs.

ELAINE: What about ponies? What kind of abnormal animal is that? And those kids who had their own ponies..

JERRY: I know, I hated those kids. In fact, I hate anyone that ever had a pony when they were growing up.

MANYA: ..I had a pony.

(The room is dead quiet)

JERRY: ..Well, I didn't really mean a pony, per se.

MANYA: (Angry) When I was a little girl in Poland, we all had ponies. My sister had pony, my cousin had pony, ..So, what's wrong with that?

JERRY: Nothing. Nothing at all. I was just merely expressting..

HELEN: Should we have coffee? Who's having coffee?

MANYA: He was a beautiful pony! And I loved him.

JERRY: Well, I'm sure you did. Who wouldn't love a pony? Who wouldn't love a person that had a pony?

MANYA: You! You said so!

JERRY: No, see, we didn't have ponies. I'm sure at the time in Poland, they were very common. They were probably like compact cars..

MANYA: That's it! I've had enough! (She leaves the room)

ISAAC: Have your coffee, everyone. She's a little upset. It's been an emotional day.

(Isaac leaves, everyone looks at Jerry)

JERRY: I didn't know she had a pony. How was I to know she had a pony? Who figures an immigrant's going to have a pony? Do you know what the odds are on

that? I mean, in all the pictures I saw of immigrants on boats coming into New York harbor, I never saw one of them sitting on a pony. Why would anybody come

hre if they had a pony? Who leaves a country packed with ponies to come to a non-pony country? It doesn't make sense.. am I wrong?

(Scene ends)

[Setting: Jerry's apartment]

(Morty and Helen are leaving, their bags are packed)

JERRY: I'll drive you to the airport.

HELEN: No, we're taking a cab.

JERRY: I just hope that whole pony incident didn't put a damper on the trip.

HELEN: Don't be rediculous. It was a misunderstanding.

MORTY: Hey, I agree with him. Nobody likes a kid with a pony.

JERRY: Well, if you ever talk to her, tell her I'm sorry. Elaine too. She feels terrible.

HELEN: You know, you should give Manya a call.

JERRY: Maybe I will.

(Jerry opens his door, Kramer's standing in the hallway)

KRAMER: Oh, hi. I just came to say goodbye. (Gestures to the bags) ..Need any help with those?

MORTY: It's nothing. I got it. So, how are your levels coming along?

KRAMER: Oh, well.. I decided I'm not gonna do it.

JERRY: (Sarcastically) Really? What a shock.

HELEN: Goodbye, Jerry.

JERRY: Take care.

HELEN: We'll call you. (Leaves)

MORTY: Bye, Jer.

JERRY: Bye, Dad. Take it easy.

MORTY: Bye, Mr. Kramer.

KRAMER: Yeah. So long, Morty. (Morty leaves)

JERRY: So, when do I get my dinner?

KRAMER: There's no dinner. The bet's off. I'm not gonna do it.

JERRY: Yes. I know you're not gonna do it. That's why I bet.

KRAMER: There's not bet if I' not doing it.

JERRY: That's the bet! That you're not doing it!

KRAMER: Yeah, well, I could do it. I don't want to do it.

JERRY: We didn't bet on if you wanted to. We bet on if it would be done.

KRAMER: And it could be done.

JERRY: Well, of course it could be done! Anything could be done! But it only is done if it's done. Show me the levels! The bet is the levels.

KRAMER: But I don't want the levels!

JERRY: That's the bet! (Phone rings, Jerry answers it) Hello? ..No, oh, hi.. no, they just left.. Oh my God.. hand on a second. Maybe I can still catch them. (Jerry

goes over to the window, and opens it. He yells out of it) Ma!.. Ma!.. Up here! Don't get in the cab! .. Manya died! ..Manya died!!

(Scene ends)

[Setting: Jerry's apartment]

HELEN: Who did you talk to?

JERRY: Uncle Leo.

HELEN: And when's the funeral?

JERRY: I don't know. He said he'd call back.

MORTY: You know what this means, don't you? We lost the supersaver. Those tickets are non-refundable.

HELEN: She just had a check-up. The doctor said she was fine. Unless..

JERRY: What?

HELEN: What? Nothing.

JERRY: You don't think.. What? The pony remark?

HELEN: Oh, don't be ridiculous. She was an old woman.

JERRY: You don't think that I killed her?

MORTY: You know what the flight back'll cost us?

JERRY: It was just an innocent comment! I didn't know she had a pony!

MORTY: Maybe we can get an army transport flight. They got a base in Sarasota, I think.

JERRY: The whole thing ws taking out of context. It was a joke. (Phone rings) That's probably Uncle Leo.

(Helen picks it up)

HELEN: Hello? ..Yes, I know.. Well, it's just one of those things.. Sure, sure, we'll see you then. (Hangs up) The funeral's Wednesday.

JERRY: Wednesday? What, what Wednesday?

HELEN: Two o' clock, Wednesday. (Jerry shrugs) What?

JERRY: I've got the softball game on Wednesday. It's the championship.

HELEN: So? You're not obligated. Go play in your game.

JERRY: I didn't even know the woman.

HELEN: So don't go.

JERRY: I mean I met her three times. I don't know her last name.

HELEN: Jery, no one's forcing you.

JERRY: I mean, who has a funeral on a Wednesday? That's what I want to know. I mean, it's the championship. I'm hitting everything.

HELEN: I don't have a dress to wear. (To Morty) And you. You don't have anything.

MORTY: I got a sport jacket.

HELEN: You're not wearing that to a funeral.

MORTY: What's wrong with it?

HELEN: It looks ridiculous.

MORTY: What? I'm gonna buy a new jacket now?

JERRY: I don't know what to do.

MORTY: ..You know what this funeral's gonna wind up costing me? Oh boy!

(Scene ends)

[Setting: Night club]

JERRY: We don't understand death. And the proof of this is that we give dead people a pillow. And, uh, I mean, hey, you know. I think if you can't stretch out and

get some solid rest at that point, I don't see how bedding accessories really make the difference. I mean, they got the guy in a suit with a pillow. No is he going to a

meeting, or is he catching forty winks? I mean, let's make up our mind where we think they're going.

(Scene ends)

[Setting: Coffee Shop]

ELAINE: I actually like ponies. I was just trying to make conversation. What time's your game?

JERRY: Two Forty-Five.

ELAINE: And what time's the funeral?

JERRY: Two o' clock.

ELAINE: How long does a funeral take?

JERRY: Depends on how nice the person was. But you gotta figure, even Oswald took forty-five minutes.

ELAINE: So you cna't do both?

JERRY: You know, if the situation were reversed and Manya had some mah-jongg championship or something, I wouldn't expect her to go to my funeral. I would

understand.

ELAINE: How can you even consider not going?

GEORGE: You know, I've been thinking.. I cannot envision any circumstances in which I'll ever have the opportunity to have sex again. How's it gonna happen? I

just don't see how it could occur.

ELAINE: You know, funerals always make me think about my own mortality and how I'm actually going to die someday. Me, dead. Imagine that.

GEORGE: They always make me take stock of my life and how I've pretty much wasted all of it, and how I plan to continue wasting it.

JERRY: I know, and then you say to yourself, "From this moment on, I'm not going to waste any more of it." But then you go, "How? What can I do that's not

wasting it?"

ELAINE: Is this a waste of time? What should we be doing? Can't you hae coffee with people?

GEORGE: You know, I can't believe you're even considering not playing. We need you. You're hitting everything.

ELAINE: He has to go. He may have killed her.

JERRY: Me? What about you? You brought up the pony.

ELAINE: Oh, yeah, but I didn't say I hated anyone who had one.

GEORGE: (To Jerry) Who's going to play left field?

JERRY: Bender.

GEORGE: Bender? He can't play left. He stinks. I just don't see what purpose is it going to serve your going? I mean, you think dead peole care who's at the

funeral? They don't even know they're having a funeral. It's not like she's hanging out in the back going, "I can't believe Jerry didn't show up."

ELAINE: Maybe she's there in spirit. How about that?

GEORGE: If you're a spirit, and you can travel to other dimensions and galaxies, and find out the mysteries of the universe, you think she's going to want to hang

around Drexler's funeral home on Ocean Parkway?

ELAINE: George, I met this woman! She is not traveling to any other dimensions.

GEORGE: You know how easy it is for dead people to travel? It's not like getting on a bus. One second. It's all mental.

JERRY: Fifty years they were married. Now he's moving to Pheonix.

ELAINE: Phoenix? What's happening with his appartment?

JERRY: I don't know. They've been in there since, like, World War II. The rent's three hundred a month.

ELAINE: Three hundred a month? Oh my God.

(Scene ends)

[Setting: Funeral home]

(The eulogy is in progress. Jerry attended afterall)

MAN: Although this may seem like a sad even, it should not be a day of mourning.. for Manya had a rich, fulfilling life. She grew up in a different world - a simpler

world - with loving parents, a beautiful home in the country, and from what I understand, she eve had a pony.. (Jerry throws his hands up) Oh, how she loved that

pony. Even in her declining years, whenever she would speak of it, her eyes would light up. It's lustrous coat, it's flowing mane. It was the pride of Krakow. (Jery

sinks in his seat)

(Scene ends)

[Setting: Anteroom of funeral parlor]

JERRY: (Looking at his watch) Well, the game's starting just about now.

HELEN: It was good that the two of you came. It was a nice gesture.

(Scene cuts to Morty talking to an intern)

INTERN: I'm not a doctor yet, Uncle Morty. I'm just an intern. I can't write a note to an airline.

MORTY: You've got your degree. They don't care. They just want to see something.

(Scene cuts back to Jerry)

JERRY: (To Isaac) I just wanted to say how sorry I was..

LEO: (Interrupting) Jerry, you wanna hear something? Your cousin, Jeffrey, is switching parks. They're transferring him to Riverside - so he'll completely revamp that

operation, you understand? He'll do in Riverside what he did in Central Park. It's more money. So, that's your cousin.

(Scene cuts back to Morty)

MORTY: You don't understand, I've never paid a full fare.

JERRY: (To Isaac) Once again, I just want to say how sorry I am abou tthe other night.

ELAINE: Oh, me too.

ISAAC: Oh no, no, no. She forgot all about that. She was much mor upset about the potato salad.

ELAINE: So, I understand you're moving to Phoenix?

(Jerry shake his head and walks away)

ISAAC: Yeah, my brother lives there. I think Manya would've liked Phoenix.

ELAINE: Mmm.. gorgeous, exquisite town. Who, what's happening with your apartment?

ISAAC: Of course it's very hot there. I'l lhave to get an air conditioner.

ELAINE: Oh, you can have mine. I'll ship it out ot you.. but what about that big apartment on West End Avenue?

ISAAC: Although they say it's a dry heat.

ELAINE: Dry, wet.. what's happening with your apartment?

ISAAC: I don't even know if I should take my winter clothing.

ELAINE: I have an idea. Leave the winter clothing in the apartment, and I'll watch it for you and I'll live there and I'll make sure that nothing happens to it.

(Jerry comes back)

ISAAC: Oh, the apartment. Jeffrey's taking the apartment.

ELAINE: (to Jerry) Oh, Jeffrey.

JERRY: (To Elaine) You know Jeffery?

ELAINE: Yeah, from what I understand, he works for the Parks Department.

(Helen approaches Jerry)

HELEN: It's raining.

JERRY: (Moves to the window) It's raining? It's raining. The game will be postponed. We'll play tomarrow.

(Scene cuts back to Morty)

MORTY: Believe me, I wouldn't bother you if the army hadn't closed that base in Sarasota. Here, scribble a little something here.

INTERN: I can't. I'll get in trouble.

MORTY: Oh, for God's sakes!

(Scene ends)

[Setting: Coffee Shop]

GEORGE: Who gets picked off in softball? It's unheard of.

JERRY: It's never happend to me before.

ELAINE: I remember saying to myself, "Why is Jerry so far off the base?"

JERRY: I'll have to live with this shame for the rest of my life.

GEORGE: And they in the fifth inning, why did you take off on the pop fly?

JERRY: I thought there were two outs.

ELAINE: I couldn't believe it when I saw you running. I thought maybe they had changed the rules or something.

JERRY: It was the single worst moment of my life.

GEORGE: What about Sharon Besser?

JERRY: Oh, well, of course. 1973.

ELAINE: Makes you wonder, though, doesn't it?

JERRY: Wonder about what?

ELAINE: You know.. the spirit world.

JERRY: You think Manya showed up during the game and put a hex on me?

ELAINE: I never saw anyone play like that.

JERRY: But I went ot the funeral.

ELAINE: Yeah, but that doesn't make up for killing her.

GEORGE: Maybe Manya missed the funeral because she was off visiting another galaxy that day.

JERRY: Don't you think she would've heard I was there?

GEORGE: Not necessarily. (Elaine laughs)

JERRY: Who figures and immigrant's gonna have a pony?

(Scene ends)

[Setting: Night Club]

JERRY: What is the pony? What is the point of the pony? Why do we have these animals, these ponies? What do we do with them? Besides the pony ride. Why

ponies? What are we doing with them? I mean, police don't use them for, you know, crowd control. "Hey, uh, you wanna get back behind the barricades. Hey!

Hey, little boy. Yeah, I'm talking to you. Behind the barricades!" So somebody, I assume, genetically engineered these ponies. Do you think they could make them

any size? I mean, could they make them like the size of a quarter, if they wanted? That would be fun for Monopoly, though, wouldn't it? Just have a little pony and

you put him on the, "Baltic, that's two down, go ahead. Hold it. Right ther, Baltic. yeah, that's it. Fine. Right there, hold it right there."

[Setting: Night club]

JERRY: I hate clothes, okay? I hate buying them. I hate picking them out of my closet. I can't stand every day trying to come up with little outfits for myself. I think

eventually fashion won't even exist. It won't. I think eventually we'll all be wearing the same thing. 'Cause anytime I see a movie or a TV show where there's people

from the future of another planet, they're all wearing the same thing. Somehow they decided "This is going to be our outfit. One-piece silver jumpsuit, V-stripe, and

boots. That's it." We should come up for an outfit for earth. An earth outfit. We should vote on it. Candidates propose different outfits, no speeches. They walk out,

twirl, walk off. We just sit in the audience and go, "That was nice. I could wear that."

(Scene ends)

[Setting: Clothing store]

JERRY: I think I've seen enough.

SALESMAN: Well, I might have something in the back.

ELAINE: The back? They never find anything in the back. If they had anything good in the back, they'd put it out in the front.

JERRY: Why don't they open up an entire store for the back? Call it, "Just Back." All back. No front. You walk in the front, you're immediately in the back. (Picks

up a tie display) Look, Elaine, tie car wash.

CUSTOMER: (Sees the book Elaine is holding) Oh, I just read that. That's terrific.

JERRY: (Pointing to Elaine) Her father wrote that.

CUSTOMER: Alton Benes is your father?

ELAINE: Yeah.

CUSTOMER: I always felt he deserved a wider audience.

ELAINE: I'm not so sure he wants one. (Customer leaves) Hey, don't forget Sunday, okay? You and George are coming, right? Hotel Westbury, eight o' clock.

JERRY: ..I guess I'm coming.. I mean..

ELAINE: What? What, you don't want to go now?

JERRY: No, I'll go. I'm going.

ELAINE: No, Jerry, you have to. I need a buffer. You know, I haven't seen my father in a while and.. you know.

JERRY: I'm worried I won't be able to talk to him. He's such a great writer. Frankly, I perfer the company of nitwits.

ELAINE: So, that's why we're not togeter anymore.

JERRY: (Looks at a jacket) What is this? (Holds it up) This is beautiful.. but these jackets never fit me right.

ELAINE: Try it on. (Feels it) Wow, this is soft suede.

JERRY: This may be the most perfect jacket I have ever put on. (Elaine grabs the tag) How much is it?

ELAINE: (Shocked) Oh my God.

JERRY: Bad? (Elaine nods) ..Very bad?

ELAINE: You have no idea.

JERRY: I have some idea.

ELAINE: No idea.

JERRY: I've got a ballpark.

ELAINE: There is no park and the team has relocated.

JERRY: (Looks at the tag) ..That is high.

ELAINE: Oh man, that is a beautiful jacket, though.

JERRY: (Looking at the insides of the jacket) What's with the pink lining and the candy stripes?

ELAINE: Well, it's just a lining. You can always have it changed.

JERRY: Should I get it? I hate these moments. I'm hearing the dual voices now, you know. "What about the money?" "What's money?"

SALESMAN: It looks wonderful on you.

(Scene ends)

[Setting: Jerry's apartment]

(Jerry's sitting on his couch wearing his pajamas and his new jacket. He gets up to look at his jacket in the mirror. Kramer enters)

JERRY: Hey.

KRAMER: Hey. New jacket?

JERRY: What do you think?

KRAMER: It's beautiful.

JERRY: Is it me?

KRAMER: That's definitely you.

JERRY: Really?

KRAMER: That's more you than you've ever been. (Starts looking the jacket over) What is with the pink lining?

JERRY: I don't know. It's got a pink lining.

KRAMER: Oh.. So, what did you pay for this?

JERRY: I paid what it costs.

KRAMER: How much?

JERRY: What's the difference?

KRAMER: What, you're not gonna tell me?

JERRY: I'd rather not say it out loud. It's embarrassing.

KRAMER: Over three hundred?

JERRY: Yes, but let's just stop it right there.

KRAMER: It's over four hundred?

JERRY: Really, I'm not answering anymore.

KRAMER: Is it over four hundred?

JERRY: Would you?

KRAMER: (Finds the tag) Woah, Nelson!

JERRY: I know, I know.

KRAMER: (Talking about his old jacket) What are you gonna do with the leather one?

JERRY: I don't know.

KRAMER: Well, are you gonna wear it?

JERRY: Maybe.

KRAMER: (Looking over the leather jacket) You're not going to wear this.

JERRY: Do you want it?

KRAMER: Well, yeah. Okay. I'll take it.. I like the jacket.

JERRY: (Takes one last look at the leather jacket) ..Okay, take it.

KRAMER: Good karma for you. (Kramer puts on his new jacket, and stands next to Jerry, looking in the mirror.) Oh baby.

(Scene ends)

[Setting: Jerry's apartment]

(George enters singing "Master Of the House" - a Les Miserables show tune)

GEORGE: "Master of the house.. doling out the charm, ready with a handshake and an open palm. Tells a saucy talke, loves to make a stir everyone appreciates a.."

JERRY: What is that song?

GEORGE: Oh, it's from Les Miserables. I went to see it last wee. I can't get it out of my head. I just keep singing it over and over. It just comes out. I have no

control over it. I'm singing it on elevators, buses. I sing it infront of clients. It's taking over my life.

JERRY: You know, Schumann went mad from that.

GEORGE: Artie Schumann? From Camp Hatchapee?

JERRY: No, you idiot.

GEORGE: What are you, Bud Abbott? What, are you calling my an idiot?

JERRY: You don't know Rober Schumann? The composer?

GEORGE: Oh, Schumann. Of course.

JERRY: (Trying to scare George) He went crazy from one note. He couldn't get it out of his head. I think it was an A. He kept repeating it over and over again. He

had to be institutionalized.

GEORGE: Really? ..Well, what if it doesn't stop? (Jerry gestures "That's the breaks." George gasps) Oh, that I really needed to hear. That helps a lot! Alright, just

say something. Just start talking. Change the subject.. Let's just go, alright? I can't believe we're having dinner with Alton Benes.

JERRY: I know exactly what's goin to happen tonight. I'm gonna try and act like I'm not impressed, he's gonna see right through it.

GEORGE: Yeah, he'll be looking at us like he's backstage at a puppet show.

JERRY: Let me just get my jacket. (Moves to the bedroom)

GEORGE: "Master of the house, keeper of the inn.." (Jerry proudly models his new jacket infront of George. George looks in admiration at the jacket) This is huge!

When did this happen?

JERRY: Wednesday. This jacket has completely changed my life. When I leave the house in this, it's with a whole different confidence. Like tonight, I might've been

a little nervous. But, inside this jacket, I am composed, grounded, secure that I can meet an social challenge.

GEORGE: (Nods) Can I say one thing to you? And I say this wiht an unblemished record of staunch heterosexuality.

JERRY: Absolutely.

GEORGE: ..It's fabulous.

JERRY: I know.

GEORGE: And I'll tell you something else, I'm not even going to ask you. I want to know. But I'm not going to ask. You'll tell me when you feel comfortable.. So

what was it? Four hundred? Five hundred? Did you pay five hundred for this? (Jerry's acting coy throughout the whole thing) Over six? Can't be seven. Don't tell my

you paid seven hundred dollars for this jacket! Did you pay seven hundred dollars for this jacket? Is that what you're saying to me?! You are sick! Is that what you

paid for this jacket?! Over seven hundred? What did you pay for this jacket? I won't say anything. I wanna know what you paid for this jacket! Oh my God! A

thousand dollars?! You paid a thousand dollars for this jacket?! Alright, fine. I'm walking out of here right now thinking you paid a thousand dollars for this jacket,

unless you tell me different. (Jerry still coy, stays silent) Oh, ho! Alright! I'll tell you what, if you don't say anything in the next five seconds, I'll know it was over a

thousand..

(Enter Kramer)

KRAMER: Hey. Hey, would you do me a solid?

JERRY: Well, what kind of solid?

KRAMER: I need you to sit in the car for two minutes while it's double-parked. I gotta pick up some birds.

JERRY: Birds?

KRAMER: Yeah. A friend of mine, he's a magician. He's going away on vacation. He asked me to take care of his doves.

JERRY: So take a cab.

KRAMER: They won't take a cage full of birds.

JERRY: I can't. I'm on my way out. There's no way I can do it.

KRAMER: George, do me a solid? Two minutes.

GEORGE: Well, I'm going with him. I'd like to, I've never done a solid before.

KRAMER: Alright.. yeah.. alright, have a good one.

(Kramer leaves)

JERRY: (Scoffs) Two minutes. Believe me, I know his two minutes.. By his conception of time, his life will last over two thousand years.

(Scene ends)

[Setting: Hotel lobby]

(Jerry and George enter. George's singing "Master of the House")

GEORGE: "Master of the House. Quick to catch your eye, never wants a passerby to pass him by."

JERRY: (Points to his head) Schumann. (George gets visibly scared) Where are they?

GEORGE: Maybe he didn't show up.

JERRY: What, you don't want to do this?

GEORGE: I don't think there's ever been an appointment in my life where I wanted the other guy to show up.

GEORGE: (Sees an elderly man sitting on a leather chair) Wait a second, is that him?

JERRY: Yeah, I think it is. (They walk tward him) Where's Elaine?

GEORGE: I'm nervous.

JERRY: Excuse me.. Mister Benes?

ALTON: Yeah?

JERRY: I'm Jerry. Elaine's friend.. and this is George.

GEORGE: (Holds out his hand for a handshake) It's a great thrill to meet you, Sir.

(Alton starts hacking, George withdraws his hand)

ALTON: Sit down. Want a drink?

JERRY: Sure.

ALTON: (Summons waiter) What do you have?

JERRY: (To waiter) I'll have a cranberry juice with two limes.

GEORGE: And, I'll have a club soda with no ice.

BENES: (Gives both Jerry and George a look) I'll have another Scotch with plenty of ice.

GEORGE: You like ice?

ALTON: Huh?

GEORGE: I said, do you like ice?

ALTON: Like it?

GEORGE: Don't you think you get more without it?

ALTON: (Pauses) Where's Elaine?

JERRY: Well, we thought she was meeting you earlier. She's usually pretty punctual. (Alton remains quiet) ..Don't you find that, George?

GEORGE: Yeah, yeah. She's punctual.. and she's been late sometimes.

JERRY: Yeah, yeah. Sometimes she's on time, and sometimes she's late.

GEORGE: I guess today she's late.

JERRY: It appears that way.

GEORGE: Yep.

JERRY: Yep.

(Both Jerry and George look at the door, anticipating Elaine's arrival)

ALTON: Looks like rain.

GEORGE: (Perks up) I know, I know, that's what they said.

ALTON: Who said?

GEORGE: The weather guy, Dr. Waldo.

ALTON: I don't need anybody to tell me it's gonna rain.

GEORGE: No, of course not. I didn't..

ALTON: All I have to do is stick my head out the window. (Waiter shows up with the drinks) Which one's suppose to be the funny guy?

GEORGE: (Pointing at Jerry) Oh, he's the comedian.

JERRY: I'm just a regular person.

GEORGE: No, no. He's just being modest.

ALTON: We had a funny guy with us in Korea. A tailgunner. They blew his brains out all over the Pacific. (Long pause) There's nothing funny about that.

(Jerry and George turn to the door again)

JERRY: Would you excuse me a minute? I'm gonna go to the bathroom. I'll be right back.

(Jerry leaves. George is left alone with Alton)

GEORGE: I just wanted to tell you that I really enjoyed Fair Game. I thought it was just brilliant.

ALTON: Drivel.

GEORGE: Maybe some parts.

ALTON: What parts?

GEORGE: The drivel parts.. Oh my gosh, I just realized - I have to make a phone call. I can believe.. would you.. (Gets up, and leaves)

(Scene cuts to the hotel bathroom)

GEORGE: Thank you for leaving me alone with him!

JERRY: That was brutal. I can't go back out there.

GEORGE: Well, let's just leave.

JERRY: Elaine'll kill me.

GEORGE: Where is she?

JERRY: She's gotta be here soon.

GEORGE: How could she leave us alone with this lunatic? Ten more minutes, and that's it! I'm leaving. I have to tell you, this guy scares me.

JERRY: The waiter was trembling.

GEORGE: If she doesn't show up, we can't possibly have dinner with him alone.

JERRY: How are we gonna get out of it?

GEORGE: We'll say we're frightened and we have to go home.

JERRY: Yeah, that's good. He'd clunk our heads together like Moe.

GEORGE: I don't know. Just start scratching. Tell him you have the crabs. He was in the military. He'll understand that.

(Scene ends)

[Setting: Night club]

JERRY: All fathers are intimidating. They're intimidating because they are fathers. Once a man has children, for the rest of his life, his attitude is, "To hell with the

world, I can make my own people. I'll eat whatever I want. I'll wear whatever I want, and I'll create whoever I want."

(Scene ends)

[Setting: Hotel lobby]

(Jerry and George come back from the bathroom)

ALTON: Who'd you call?

GEORGE: (Caught off guard) My uncle is having an operation. I just wanted to see how he was.

ALTON: What kind of operation?

GEORGE: Bone marrow.

(Manager approaches)

MANAGER: Mister Benes?

ALTON: Yes?

MANAGER: A message for you. (Hands him a message)

ALTON: From Elaine. She got tied up. She'll be here in thirty minutes. (Jerry and George freeze)

(Scene ends)

[Setting: Hotel lobby]

ALTON: Yeah, they should've taken care of Castro when they had the chance. Like we did in Guatamala in 'fifty-three.

JERRY: (Adding) Well, Guatamala.

GEORGE: Sure, Guatamala.

ALTON: (Gets up) Alright, you boys get yourselves together. We'll head up to the restaurant. I'll leave a note for Elaine. I'm going to the bathroom. (Leaves)

GEORGE: Come on, let's go!

JERRY: What about Elaine?

GEORGE: To hell with Elaine!

JERRY: She'll be furious.

GEORGE: We're dying here!

(Elaine enters)

JERRY: That's her! She's here!

ELAINE: I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Where is Dad?

GEORGE: (Mocking Alton's voice) He's in the bathroom.

JERRY: Where have you been?!

ELAINE: Kramer, that .. Kramer! I'm just about to leave, he calls me up. He begs me to sit in his car for two minutes, so he can pick up these birds..

JERRY: Oh, you didn't..

ELAINE: Well, he said he'd drive me here right after. So, I am sitting in his car twenty minutes! he doesn't come down. I am freezing. Then a cop comes by, tells me

to get out of the car. He's a city marshal. He's towing the car away. Kramer owes thousands of dollars in back tickets. He was going to tow it with me in the car!

So, they tow the car. Now, I am standing outside, and I am freezing, but I cannot leave because I have to tell him what happened to the car.. so, finally, he finally

comes down with his giant cage filled with doves. He said he was getting special instructions, that each dove has a different diet. So, we're wandering around trying

to get a cab, when two of these doves fly out! Now we're running down the street after these doves. I almost got hit by a bus. (Sits down, takes a deep breath) ..So

how's everything going over here?

JERRY: (After hearing Elaine's story, his is..) Great.

GEORGE: Couldn't be better.

ELAINE: Good. 'Cause Dad can make some people a little uncomfortable.

JERRY: Oh, no, no.

GEORGE: Get outta here..

ELAINE: Man, Kramer! I could kill him.

JERRY: I can't believe it. You know better than to get involved with Kramer.

ELAINE: He said he'd give me a lift.

JERRY: Ah, the lift. Like the lure of the siren's song. Never what it seems to be, yet who among us can resist?

GEORGE: Where do you come up with this stuff?

ALTON: (Returns) Well, look who's here.

ELAINE: Oh, Hi, Dad.

ALTON: (Kisses Elaine) Hello, dear. Who's the lipstick for?

ELAINE: No one.

ALTON: ..How's your mother?

ELAINE: Fine.

ALTON: How about you? Are you working?

ELAINE: Yeah, I'm reading manuscripts for Pendant Publishing. I told you ten times.

ALTON: Pendant, those bastards.. Alright, boys. We'll go to that Pakistani restaurant on 46th Street. You're not afraid of a little spice, are you?

(They all head for the door. Jerry and George trail behind a little)

GEORGE: "Master of the house, doling out the charm. Ready with a handshake and an open.."

ALTON: Pipe down, chorus boy.

(Alton glares, George gets embarrassed)

ELAINE: Ohh.. it's snowing. It's beautiful.

JERRY: (To George) Snow.. snow, that can't be good for suede, can it?

GEORGE: I wouldn't think so.

JERRY: What should I do? (To Alton) We're taking a cab, aren't we?

ALTON: Cab? It's only five blocks.

GEORGE: (To Jerry) Why don't you just turn it inside out?

JERRY: Inside out! Great.

(Jery turns his jacket inside out, showing of the pink striped insides. Alton stops him before Jerry can leave the hotel)

ALTON: Wait a minute. What the hell do you call this?

JERRY: Oh, I turned my jacket inside out.

ALTON: Well, you look like a damn fool!

JERRY: (Like a child) Well, it's a new suede jacket. It might get ruined.

ALTON: Well, you're not going to walk down the street with my and my daughter dressed like that! That's for damn sure!

(Jerry looks at George)

GEORGE: It's only a few blocks.

(Scene ends)

[Setting: Jerry's apartment]

(Jerry's heading out, the intercom buzzes)

JERRY: (Into intercom) Elaine?

ELAINE: Yeah.

JERRY: Come on up.

(Enter Kramer)

KRAMER: Hey.

JERRY: Hey.

KRAMER: I've gotta feed the birds.

JERRY: So?..

KRAMER: You got any of those mini Ritzes?

(Jerry reaches up, and pulls out some mini Ritzes)

JERRY: I can't believe I do.

KRAMER: Yeah! ..Well, are you going out?

JERRY: Yeah.

KRAMER: Hey, where's your new jacket? (Jerry points to the jacket hanging in the bathroom. It's ruined, and unwearable) What? (Kramer enters the bathroom,

he's shocked at the sight of the jacket) Ohhh. What did you do to it?

JERRY: I was out in the snow last night.

KRAMER: Don't youk now what that does to suede?

JERRY: I have an idea. (Elaine enters) We can make the nine-thirty at Cinema III.

ELAINE: Okay.. (To Kramer) Hello. (To Jerry) Listen, thanks again for coming last night. Dad said he had a great time.

JERRY: Is he still in town?

ELAINE: No, he's driving back to Maryland tonight.

KRAMER: (Talking about the ruined jacket) So, uh.. what are you gonna do with that one now?

JERRY: I don't know.

KRAMER: Well?..

ELAINE: (To Jerry) I didn't want to tell you this, but usually he hates everyone.

JERRY: Really?

KRAMER: You gonna throw this out?

JERRY: Well, I can't wear it.

ELAINE: (To Jerry) Yeah, he like you though. Said you reminded him of somebody he knew in Korea.

KRAMER: Well, if you're just gonna throw it out, you know, I could take it.

JERRY: Yeah, go ahead, take it.

ELAINE: Dad thinks George is gay.

JERRY: Oh, because of all that singing?

ELAINE: No, he pretty much thinks everyone is gay.

(Kramer returns from the bathroom wearing the ruined suede jacket)

KRAMER: Hey, see, I like it like this.

ELAINE: (Pointing at the jacket Kramer's wearing) Isnt' that..? (Jerry nods) Oh, is this fromt he snow last night? (Jerry nods again) Ugh.. you know what you

should've done? You should've turned it inside out.

JERRY: I'll try and remember that.

KRAMER: (Talking about the leather jacket from the start of the show) Boy, it's too bad you gave me this one too.

JERRY: (Sarcastic) Yeah, too bad.

KRAMER: I'm gonna have to do something about this lining.

(Kramer exits, Scene ends)

[Setting: Alton Benes' car]

(Alton is driving home, then all the sudden, he starts to sing)

ALTON: "Master of the house doling out the charm, ready with a handshake and an open palm.."

(Scene ends)

[Setting: Night club]

JERRY: I had a leather jacket that got ruined. Now, why does moisture ruin leather? I don't get this. Aren't cows ouside most of the time? I don't understand it.

When it's raining do cows go up to the farmhouse, "Let us in, we're all wearing leather.. Open the door! We're gonna ruin the whole outfit here.." "Is it suede?" "I am

suede, the whole thing is suede, I can't have this cleaned. It's all I got!"

Jerry's opening monologue:
The bad thing about television is that everybody you see on television is

doing something better than what you're doing. Did you ever see anybody on TV

like just sliding off the front of the sofa with potato chip crumbs on their

face? Some people have a little too much fun on television: the soda

commercial people - where do they summon this enthusiasm? Have you seen them?

"We have soda, we have soda, we have soda", jumping, laughing, flying through

the air - it's a can of soda. Have you ever been standing there and you're

watching TV and you're drinking the exact same product that they're advertising

right there on TV, and it's like, you know, they're spiking volleyballs,

jetskiing, girls in bikinis and I'm standing there - "Maybe I'm putting too much

ice in mine."



Monk's Diner, day. George and Jerry enter. George is excited:

George: So then, as we were leaving, we were just kind of standing there,

and she was sort of smiling at me, and I wasn't sure if she wanted me to ask her

out, because when women smile at me I don't know what it means. Sometimes I

interpret it like they're Psychotic or something and I don't know if I'm

supposed to smile back, I don't know what to do. So I just stood there like -

remember how Quayle looked when Benson gave him that Kennedy line? - that's what

I looked like.

Jerry: So you didn't ask?

George: No, I froze.

Jerry: (Points to counter) Counter.



George: Oh yeah. So wait, wait. A half-hour later I'm back in the office,

I tell Lloyd the whole story. He says "So why don't you call her". I says "I

can't." I couldn't, I couldn't do it right then. For me to ask a woman out I

gotta get into a mental state like the karate guys before they break the bricks.

So Lloyd calls me a wuss.

Jerry: He said wuss?

George: Yeah. Anyway, he shamed me into it.

Jerry: So you called. (They sit at counter)

George: Right. And, and to cover my nervousness I started eating an apple,

because I think if they hear you chewing on the other end of the phone, it

makes you sound casual.

Jerry: Yeah, like a farm boy.

George: Right. So I call her up, I tell her it's me, she gives me an

enthusiastic 'Hi!'

Jerry: Wow. Enthusiastic 'Hi!', that's beautiful.

George: Oh, I don't get the enthusiastic 'Hi!', I'm outta there.

Jerry: Alright, so you're chewing your apple, you got your enthusiastic

'Hi!' Go ahead.

George: So, we're talking, and I don't like to go too long before I ask them

out, I wanna get it over with right away, so I just blurt out "What are you

doing Saturday night?"

Jerry: And?

George: She bought.

Jerry: Great day in the morning.

George: Then I got off the phone right away.

Jerry: Sure, it's like robbing a bank: you don't loiter around in front of

the teller holding that big bag of money. You come in, you hit and get out.

George: It's amazing: we, we both have dates on the same night. I can't

remember the last time that happened.



George's car, parked outside apartment building, night. George and his date

Carol:

George: I can't stand doing laundry. That's why I have forty pairs of

underwear.

Carol: You do not.

George: Absolutely. Because instead of doing a wash, I just keep buying

underwear. My goal is to have over three hundred and sixty pair. That way, I

only have to do wash once a year.

(They both laugh)



Jerry's car, also parked outside an apartment building. Jerry and his

girlfriend Donna:

Jerry: (In awful Scots/Irish accent) Come on, try it. Let me hear you try

a Scottish accent.

Donna: That's Irish.

Jerry: Irish, Scottish, what's the difference, lassie?

(Donna laughs)



Back to George and Carol:

Donna: So, er, thanks for dinner. It was great.

George: Yeah. We should do this again.

Donna: Would you like to come upstairs for some coffee?

George: Oh, no, thanks. I can't drink coffee late at night, it keeps me up.

Donna: (Looks disappointed) So, um, OK.

George: OK.

Donna: Goodnight.

George: Yeah, take it easy.

(Donna leaves car. George realizes what he has done and bashes his

forehead in disgust)



Back to Jerry and Donna:

Donna: Thanks again for the movie.

Jerry: You're welcome.

Donna: I'd invite you up, but the place is being painted.

Jerry: Oh, that's OK.

Donna: Unless you want to go to your place.

Jerry: OK, but there's no cake or anything, if that's what you're looking

for.



Back to George, driving, looking frustrated:

George: Take it easy, huh, take it easy.



Jerry's apartment. Jerry and Donna sit on the sofa:

Jerry: I think if one's going to kill oneself, the least you could do is

leave a note - it's common courtesy. I don't know, that's just the way I was

brought up.

Donna: Values are very important.

Jerry: Oh, so important. So what are you doing Thursday night - you wanna

have dinner?

Donna: Thursday's great. (Moves closer)

Jerry: (Looks at his pants) Tan pants. Why do I buy tan pants, Donna? I

don't feel comfortable in them.

Donna: Are those Cotton Dockers?

Jerry: Oh, I can't begin to tell you how much I hate that commercial.

Donna: Really? I like that commercial. (Jerry pauses)

Jerry: You like that commercial?

Donna: Yeah, it's clever.

Jerry: Now wait a second, you mean the one where the guys are all standing

around, supposedly being very casual and witty?

Donna: Yeah, that's the one.

Jerry: What could you possibly like about that?

Donna: I don't know, I like the guys.

Jerry: Yeah, they're so funny and so comfortable with each other, and I

could be comfortable too, if I had pants like that. I could sit on a porch and

wrestle around, and maybe even be part of a real bull session.

Donna: Hey, I know guys like that. To me the dialogue rings true.

Jerry: (Shrugs. Pause) Even if the dialogue did ring true. Even if

somehow somewhere men actually talk like that, what does that have to do with

the pants? Doesn't that bother you?

Donna: (Increasingly annoyed) That's the idea. That's what's clever about

it, that they're not talking about the pants.

Jerry: But they're talking about nothing.

Donna: That's the point.

Jerry: I know the point.

Donna: No one is telling you to like it.

Jerry: I mean, all those quick shots of the pants, just pants, pants,

pants, pants, pants, pants, pants. What is that supposed to be?

(Donna sighs, leans away from Jerry, looks at watch)



Jerry monologue:

What's brutal about the date is the scrutiny that you put each other

through. Because whenever you think about this person in terms of the future,

you have to magnify everything about them. You know, like the guy'll be like

'I don't think her eyebrows are even. Could I look at uneven eyebrows for the

rest of my life?' And of course the woman's looking at the guy, thinking 'What

is he looking at? Do I want somebody looking at me like this for the rest of my

life?'



Jerry's apartment, day. Jerry and Elaine:

Jerry: I'm supposed to see her again on Thursday, but can I go out with

someone who actually likes this commercial?

Elaine: I once broke up with a guy because he didn't keep his bathroom clean

enough.

Jerry: No kidding. Did you tell him that was the reason?

Elaine: Oh yeah, I told him all the time. You would not have believed his

tub: germs were building a town in there - they were constructing offices.

Houses near the drain were going for $150,000.

(George enters, looking miserable, holding a brown paper bag)

Elaine: Hi.

(George produces Pepto-Bismol bottle and box of bicarb from bag, places

them on counter)

Jerry: You're still thinking about this?

George: (While preparing bicarb) She invites me up at twelve o clock at

night, for coffee. And I don't go up. "No thank you, I don't want coffee, it

keeps me up. Too late for me to drink coffee." I said this to her. People

this stupid shouldn't be allowed to live. I can't imagine what she must think

of me.

Jerry: She thinks you're a guy that doesn't like coffee.

George: She invited me up. Coffee's not coffee, coffee is sex.

Elaine: Maybe coffee was coffee.

George: Coffee's coffee in the morning, it's not coffee at twelve o clock at

night.

Elaine: Well some people drink coffee that late.

George: Yeah, people who work at NORAD, who're on twenty-four hour missile

watch. Everything was going along so great: she was laughing, I was funny. I

kept saying to myself "Keep it up, don't blow it, you're doing great."

Elaine: It's all in your head. All she knows is she had a good time. I

think you should call her.

George: I can't call her now, it's too soon. I'm planning a Wednesday call.

Elaine: Oh, why? I love it when guys call me the next day.

George: Of course you do, but you're imagining a guy you like, not a guy who

goes (in stupid voice) "Oh no, I don't drink coffee late at night." If I call

her now, she's gonna think I'm too needy.

Women don't wanna see need. They want a take-charge guy - a colonel, a

kaiser, a tsar.

Elaine: All she'll think is that you like her.

George: Yes, she wants me to like her, if she likes me, but she doesn't like

me!

Elaine: I don't know what your parents did to you.

(Kramer enters, points at Jerry)

Kramer: Hey, I just thought of a really funny thing for your act. Alright,

you're up there, you're on the stage and you go "Hey, you ever notice how cars

here in New York, they never get out of the way of ambulances anymore.

Someone's in a life-and-death situation, and we're thinking 'Well, sorry buddy,

you should've thought of that when you were eating cheese omelettes and sauages

for breakfast every morning for the last thirty years.'" So you gonna use it?

Jerry: I don't think so.

Kramer: It's funny.

Elaine: It is funny.

Kramer: That's as good as anything you do.

George: Alright, I gotta make a call. Everybody out, come on.

Jerry: Why do we have to leave?

George: Because I can't call a woman with other people in the room. Come

on, let's go.

Elaine: Oh, see, this is the problem.

Jerry: You're kicking me out of my house?

George: Yes.

Elaine: Don't forget.

George: Oh Jerry, do you have any apples?

Jerry: Don't do the apples. That's enough already with the apples.

(Elaine, Kramer and Jerry leave. George removes jacket, dials phone)

Phone: Hi, it's Carol, I 'll get back to you. (Beep)

George: Uhm, hi, it's George, George Costanza, remember me? The guy that

didn't come up for coffee.

You see, I didn't realise that coffee didn't really mean ... well,

whatever. Anyway, it was fun. It was, erm, it was fun, so, oh boy, uhm, so,

you call me back. If you want, it's up to you, you know, whatever you wanna do.

Either way. The ball's in your court. So, er, take it easy.

(Hangs up. Jerry enters)

Jerry: I'm just gonna get my jacket, I'll meet you downstairs. What's the

matter, did you call?

(Elaine enters)

George: Got her machine. I'm dead, I'm a dead man. That's it. I'm dead,

I'm a dead man. Dead man.

Jerry: What did you say?

George: I don't know what the hell I said. I gave her an ultimatum and

there's nothing I can do. It's a machine. The little light is blinking right

now: 'Come and listen to the idiot. Hey everybody, the idiot's on!'

Jerry: After one date you try and improvise on her machine?

George: Now I'm in the worst position of all.

Elaine: Y'know, my brother-in-law once left a message on this guy's machine,

and he blurted out some business information he wasn't supposed to, and it would

have cost him $15,000, so he waited outside the guy's house and when the guy

came home he went upstairs with him and he switched the tape.

George: He did that?

Elaine: Yeah.

George: Somebody did that?

Jerry: She'll call you back. You're overreacting.



Jerry's apartment. Jerry and Donna:

Jerry: Not once.

Donna: Never?

Jerry: I have never seen one episode of 'I Love Lucy' in my life ever.

Donna: That's amazing.

Jerry: Thank you.

Donna: Is there anything else about you I should know?

Jerry: Yes, I'm lactose intolerant.

Donna: Really?

Jerry: I have no patience for lactose. And I won't stand for it. Uhm,

I'll be right back. (Goes to bathroom)

(George enters)

George: Wait till you hear this (sees Donna). Whoa, ah, I'm sorry, I

didn't, I had no idea. (Goes to leave)

Donna: Wait, wait. He's in the bathroom.

George: I just wanted to talk to him for a minute, but I'll come back.

Donna: You don't have to leave.

George: You sure?

Donna: Yes.

George: OK.

Donna: I'm Donna.

George: Donna. Oh, you're the one that likes that commercial!

Donna: He told you about that.

George: No, he, he didn't actually tell me that, uh, we were talking about

that commercial, in fact I think I brought it up because I like that commercial.

No, he, he would never tell me anything like that. He never discusses anything.

He's, he's like a clam. You're not gonna mention this, to him.. (Jerry re-

enters)

Donna: (To Jerry) So you go around telling your friends I'm not hip

because I like that commercial.

Jerry: What? (To George) What did, what did you say?

George: Say? What? Nothing, I..

Donna: You told him how I like the commercial.

Jerry: Well, so what if I said that?

Donna: Well, so, you didn't have to tell your friends.

Jerry: No, I had to tell my friends, my friends didn't have to tell you.

George: (To Donna) Why did you have to get me in trouble?

Donna: I don't like you talking about me with your friends behind my back.

George: Boy oh boy.

Jerry: I said I couldn't believe you liked that commercial. So what?

Donna: I asked some friends of mine this week, and all of them liked the

commercial.

Jerry: Boy, I bet you got a regular Algonquin round table there.

(Kramer enters)

K Hey.

Jerry: Oh, Kramer, this is Donna.

k Oh. Cotton Dockers!

George: Hello! Alright, we should be going. Come on .(Grabs Kramer)

k What? Where are we going?

George: Come on!

Donna: Don't bother, I'm leaving.

Jerry: Donna, really, you're making too much of this.

K One hundred percent Cotton Dockers, if they're not Dockers, they're just

pants!

Jerry: Please, Donna.

Donna: I don't wanna hear it.(Leaves)

George: I can't believe I said that. You know me, I'm a vault.

Jerry: Don't worry about it, it wasn't working anyway.

k What happened there?

Jerry: I'll tell you later.

George: You are not gonna believe what's going on with this woman.





Monk's Diner. George and Jerry sat in booth:

George: OK, so you remember I made the initial call Sunday, she doesn't call

back. I call again Monday, I leave another message. I call Tuesday, I get the

machine again: "I know you're there, I don't know what your story is."

Yesterday, I'm a volcano - I try one more call, the machine comes on, and fly

like Mussolini from the balcony- "Where the hell do you get the nerve? You

invite me up for coffee and then you don't call me back for four days? I don't

like coffee, I don't have to come up. I'd like to get one more shot at the

coffee just so I could spit it in your face."

Jerry: You said that?

George: I lost it.

Jerry: I can't blame you. I can't believe she never called you back.

George: She did. Today.

Jerry: What?

George: She called my office. She said she's been in the Hamptons since

Sunday. She didn't know if I was trying to get in touch with her. Her machine

broke, and she's been using her old machine and she doesn't have the beeper for

it.

Jerry: So she didn't get the messages.

George: Exactly, but they're on there waiting. She said she can't wait to

see me, we're having dinner tonight. She's supposed to call me as soon as she

gets home.

Jerry: But what about the messages?

(George produces cassette tape from pocket)

Jerry: Elaine's thing? How you gonna get in?

George: I'll meet her outside the building.

Jerry: But you know as soon as she gets in the apartment she's going right

for that machine.

George: Or she goes for the bathroom. That's my only chance. Who am I

kidding? I can't do this, I can't do this. I don't even know how to work those

stupid machines.

Jerry: There's nothing to it. You lift the lid, it comes right out.

George: You do it for me.

Jerry: What?

George: Come on, it'll be so much easier.

Jerry: How you gonna get me up there?

George: I'll tell her I bumped into you, I'm giving you a ride uptown.

Jerry: And who makes the switch?

George: You do.

Jerry: I do.

George: I can't do it. I'll, I'll keep her busy.

Jerry: I can't get involved in this.

George: I think I may be in love with this woman.

Jerry: What if she sees me?

George: Oh, you are such a wuss.

Jerry: A wuss?

George: Yeah.

Jerry: Did you call me a wuss?



Outside apartment building, night. George and Jerry are sat on a low wall:

George: Well there is traffic. It might take her till eight-fifteen.

Jerry: I got one problem: you're keeping her busy in the other room. Now,

what if she somehow gets away from you and is coming in? You have to signal me

that she's coming.

George: A signal, right, erm, OK, er OK, the signal is, I'll call out 'Tippy

toe!'

Jerry: 'Tippy Toe?' I don't think so.

George: You don't like 'Tippy toe?'

Jerry: No 'Tippy toe.'

George: Alright, er, OK I got it, erm, I'll sing.

Jerry: What song?

George: Erm, 'How do you solve a problem like Maria?'

Jerry: What is that?

George: Oh, it's a lovely song. (Sings) How do you solve a problem like

Maria?

Jerry: Anything else?

George: You pick it.

Jerry: 'Lemon Tree'

George: Peter, Paul and Mary.

Jerry: No, Trini Lopez.

Both: (Singing) Lemon tree very pretty and a lemon flower

George: You got the tape?

Jerry: (Produces tapes) Standard. Micro.

George: How do you feel? Confident?

Jerry: Feel good.

George: You nervous?

Jerry: Not at all.

George: Get up, get up, it's her. Oh, the hell with this, I'm scared to

death, just walk away, it's off, cancel everything, go!

(Carol arrives)

George: Hey! What are you doing here? I thought I was supposed to call you

when I got home.

George: I, I couldn't wait. I was too anxious to see you.

Carol: Oh, that's so sweet.

George: Oh, this is my friend, Jerry Seinfeld. I just bumped into him

around the corner. Isn't that a coincidence? The funny thing is, I see him all

the time.

Jerry: All the time.

Carol: It's nice to meet you.

Jerry: Hi.

Carol: So, I'm starving. Where are we gonna eat?

George: You know, we could go uptown, and that way we could give Jerry a

ride home.

Carol: OK. Let's go, I'm ready, where'd you park?

George: Don't you wanna go upstairs first?

Carol: No, what for? I'll just give my bag to the doorman.

Jerry: You know, I really need to use the bathroom.

Carol: Oh well there's a bathroom in the coffee shop just next door.

George: Yes, yes, but er, I have to make a call, so...

Carol: Well they have a phone.

(George takes Carol to one side)

George: I know Jerry. He has this phobia about public toilets. I think we

really should go upstairs.

Carol: (Aloud) You know, I think I will go upstairs. I can check my

machine.

George: Right, right.

(They enter building)



Inside Carol's apartment. Carol, Jerry and George enter:

Carol: The bathroom's on the hall to the right.

Jerry: Er, you know, why don't you go first, you just had a long trip.

Carol: No, I'm fine.

Jerry: Uhmmm, you know, it's the damnedest thing, it went away.

Carol: Oh that's weird.

George: No, no that can happen. I've, er, I've read about that in medical

journals. It's a freak thing, but...

Carol: Well, let me just check my messages, and we'll go.

George: Uh, Carol, can I talk to you for a second? Right now.

Carol: Sure.

George: Please, this is very, very important. (Leads her to other room)

(Jerry goes over to machine to switch tape)

George: (Shouts from other room) Uhh, tippy toe! Tippy toe! Lemon tree!

(Carol reappears followed by George)

Carol: (To Jerry) Now I know who you are. You're a comedian. I've seen

you, it's driving me crazy.

Jerry: Right. I am.

George: Carol, that's so rude. Please, I'm serious, just for a moment, if

you wouldn't mind, and then we'll talk to Jerry.

(George leads Carol back out, Jerry switches tapes)

Jerry: (Shouts) Hey you two. I'm ready to go.

(George and Carol return)

Carol: That's what you had to tell me? Your father wears sneakers in the

pool?

George: (To Jerry) Don't you find that strange?

Jerry: Yes.

Carol: Well, I'll just check my machine and we'll go. No, nothing here,

let's go. Oh, I forgot to tell you. After I talked to you today my neighbour

called me and played my messages to me over the phone.

George: Oh, uhhh...

Carol: Yours were hilarious, we were both cracking up. I just love jokes

like that.

(All three leave)



Jerry's closing monologue:

I love my phone machine. I wish I was a phone machine. I wish if I saw

somebody on the street I didn't want to talk to I could go "Excuse me, I'm not

in right now. If you could just leave a message, I could walk away." I also

have a cordless phone, but I don't like that as much, because you can't slam

down a cordless phone. You get mad at somebody on a real phone - "You can't

talk to me like that!" Bang! You know. You get mad at somebody on a cordless

phone - "You can't talk to me like that!" (Mimes fiddly button-pressing) "I

told him!"

[Setting: Night club]

JERRY: Well, I painted my apartment again. I've been living in this apartment for years and years, and every time I paint it, it kinda gets me down. I look around,

and I think, well, it's a little bit smaller now. You know, I realize it's just the thickness of the paint, but I'm aware of it. It keeps coming in and coming in. Everytime I

paint it, it's closer and closer. I don't even know where the wall outlets are anymore. I just look for like a lump with two slots in it. Kinda looks like a pig is trying to

push his way through from the other side. That's where I plug in.. My idea of the perfect living room would be the bridge on the Starship Enterprise. You know what

I mean? Big chair, nice screen, remote control.. that's why Star Trek really was the ultimate male fantasy. Just hurling through space in your living room, watching

TV. That's why all the aliens were always dropping in, because Kirk was the only one that had a big screen. They came over Friday night, Klingon boxing.. gotta be

there.

(Scene ends)

[Setting: Jerry's apartment]

(Jerry and Elaine are looking at Kramer with their arms folded. His hair is slicked down)

JERRY: What did you do?

KRAMER: Mousse. I moussed up.

ELAINE: I guess it was just a matter of time.

KRAMER: You know, I should've done this years ago. I mean, I feel like I had two lives. My pre-mousse and now, I begin my post-mousse. Hey, tell me the truth,

have you ever seen a better looking guy?

JERRY: Oh, look, its so subjective.

ELAINE: I don't mean to interrupt or anything, but on Sunday, my friend is having a brunch for the New York Marathon.

KRAMER: Oh, I keep forgetting to enter that.

ELAINE: She lives right above First Avenue, and says she has a perfect view of the race. And she said I can invite some friends.

JERRY: Maybe.

(A loud argument erupts in the hallway between Harold and Manny, the building supervisors)

HAROLD: No, I'm not going up there. (Manny screams out something in Spanish)

JERRY: Harold and Manny.

HAROLD: I'm not going. (Manny says something in Spanish, Jerry goes out into the hall)

JERRY: Boys, boys.

HAROLD: Oh, Jerry.

JERRY: I slid the rent under your door, Harold. Did you get it?

HAROLD: Yeah, yeah.. (Joking) Hey, Jerry, would you like anything from Mrs. Hudwalker's apartment? (Manny starts yelling at Harold in Spanish) I was only

joking. (To Jerry) He thinks I'm going to give you Mrs. Hudwalker's things. (Manny starts talking in Spanish) We have to go up there now and clean the apartment.

It's a good thing her rent was overdue. She'd be rotting up there for a month.

JERRY: She died? ..Mrs. Hudwalker died?

HAROLD: Ninety-four years old. I found her yesterday. She didn't have a wig on. It was horrifying.

MANNY: Harold, (In Spanish) Come on, hurry up!

HAROLD: (To Manny) What's the matter with you?! I'm talking. So, Jerry, you know anyone who needs an apartment?

JERRY: Are you kidding? You know my friend Elaine?

HAROLD: Oh yeah, I like her. She always says "hello" to me.

JERRY: It's not promised to anybody? 'Cause she would take it in a second.

HAROLD: Well, Manny wanted it for his brother, but he got deported. (Manny starts protesting in Spanish) What's the difference? It's true.

JERRY: So, it's okay? I could just tell her she can have it?

HAROLD: Sure, sure. She's getting a bargain, too. It's only four hundred dollars a month. (Manny yells in Spanish) Okay.. (Manny keeps talking in Spanish) Okay.

(Jerry goes back to his apartment, passing Kramer on the way)

KRAMER: (Talking about his hair) Hey, Harold, what do you think?

HAROLD: Manny, look, Kramer put mousse in his hair.

MANNY: (In Spanish) It looks worse.

KRAMER: (Not knowing what Manny said) Thanks.

(Jerry enters his apartment)

ELAINE: What was that all about?

JERRY: Oh, nothing important.

ELAINE: What's going on? What is that look?

JERRY: What look? Nothing.

ELAINE: Something's going on here.

JERRY: I don't know if you should sit for this or not. Sitting is good if you faint, but standing is good for jumping up and down.. I can't decide.

ELAINE: Jumping up and down? What are you talking about? C'mon. Cough it up.

JERRY: Oh, Elaine. You know the way I am - rarely ever thinking of myself. My only concern is the welfare and happiness of those close to me. Sure, it hurts

sometimes - to give, and give, and give..

ELAINE: Would you please?

JERRY: What would you say if I told you that..

ELAINE: Told me what?!

JERRY: ..I got you an apartment in this building.

ELAINE: (Dumbfounded) No.

JERRY: Yes.

ELAINE: No.

JERRY: Yes.

ELAINE: You didn't.

JERRY: I did.

ELAINE: You got me an apartment in the building?!

JERRY: I got you an apartment in the building.

ELAINE: How did you..

JERRY: Remember Mrs. Hudwalker? The ninety-four-year-old woman who lived above me?

ELAINE: No.

JERRY: She died.

ELAINE: (Thrilled) She died?!

JERRY: She died.

ELAINE: She died!

JERRY: And the rent's only four hundred dollars a month!

ELAINE: Get out! (Pushes Jerry, he stumbles back) Four hundred a month? Only four hundred a month?!

JERRY: Four hundred a month.

ELAINE: And I'll be right upstairs?

JERRY: Right upstairs.

ELAINE: Right above you?

JERRY: Right above me.

ELAINE: Oh, we're neighbors. I'll be here all the time!

JERRY: (Suddenly having second thoughts) All the time..

ELAINE: We can exchange keys so we can come in and out. Oh, this is going to be great!

JERRY: ..All the time..

(Scene ends)

[Setting: Night club]

JERRY: The problem with talking is that nobody stops you from saying the wrong thing. I think life would be a lot better if it was like you're always making a movie.

You mess up, somebody just walks on the set, and stops the whole shot. You know what I mean? Think of the things you wish you could take back. You're out

somewhere with people, "Gee, you look pregnant.. are ya?" "Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, that's not gonna work at all. Walk out the door, and come back in. Let's take

this whole scene again. People, think about what you're saying!"

(Scene ends)

[Setting: Coffee shop]

GEORGE: (Pays his bill) Thanks, see ya later, Donna. (Walks out, he runs into Jerry outside the shop) What happened to you?

JERRY: You can't believe what I just did.

GEORGE: What? What did you do?

JERRY: I could tell you what I did, but you wouldn't believe it. It's not believable.

GEORGE: What did you do?

JERRY: How could I have done that?

GEORGE: Done what?

JERRY: I told Elaine about an apartment opening up in my building. She's going to move in.

GEORGE: Elaine's moving into your building?

JERRY: Yes. Right above me.

GEORGE: Right above you?

JERRY: Yes.

GEORGE: You're gonna be neighbors.

JERRY: I know. Neighbors.

GEORGE: She's right above you?

JERRY: Right above me.

GEORGE: How could you do that?

JERRY: 'Cause I'm an idiot! You may think you're an idiot, but with all due respect - I'm a much bigger idiot than you are.

GEORGE: Don't insult me, my friend. Remember who you're talking to. No one's a bigger idiot than me.

JERRY: Did you ever ask an ex-girlfriend to move into your building?

GEORGE: Did you ever go to a singles weekend in the Poconos?

JERRY: She's right in my building! Right above me! Every time I come in the building, I'm gonna have to sneak around like a cat burglar.

GEORGE: You're doomed. You're gonna have to have all your sex at women's apartments. It'll be like a permanent road trip. Forget about the home bed

advantage.

JERRY: But I need the home bed advantage!

GEORGE: Of course, we all do.

JERRY: (Gesturing to the coffee shop) Come in for two minutes and sit with me.

GEORGE: I was just in there. It's embarrassing.

JERRY: Oh, who's gonna know?

GEORGE: They saw me walk out.

JERRY: Two minutes.

(Scene cuts to Jerry and George in the coffee shop)

JERRY: My censoring system broke down. You know that little guy in your head who watches everything you say? Makes sure you don't make a mistake? He went

for a cup of coffee, and in that second - ruined my life.

GEORGE: My censor quit two years ago. He checked into a clinic. Emotionally exhausted.

JERRY: ..So, is there any way out of this Elaine thing?

GEORGE: Tough.

JERRY: You know, the water pressure's terrible in my building.. and she loves a good shower.

GEORGE: I don't think anyone's turned down an apartment because of a weak shower spray.

JERRY: If they were fanatic about showers, they might.

GEORGE: For that rent, she'd take a bath in the toilet tank if she had to..

JERRY: Look at that woman feeding her baby greasy, disgusting, coffee shop corned beef hash. Isn't that child abuse?

GEORGE: I'd like to have a kid. Of course, you have to have a date first.. remember my friend, Adam, from Detroit?

JERRY: Yeah, the guy with the flat head?

GEORGE: He's a cube.. anyway, he got married six months ago. he told me ever since he's been wearing a wedding band, women have been coming on to him

everywhere he goes.

JERRY: Yeah, I've heard that about wedding bands.

GEORGE: (Joking) I wonder if that's really true.

JERRY: That would be an interesting sociological experiment. You know, Kramer has his father's band. He'd loan it to you.

(Scene ends)

[Setting: Apartment buliding hallway]

(George is trying on a wedding band)

GEORGE: Thanks a lot. I"ll give it back to you in a week.

KRAMER: You know, I don't even know why you're fooling around with this ring. I've been telling you, get yourself some plugs, or a piece.

GEORGE: I'm not doing that.

KRAMER: Oh, man. You know, you're crazy. You're a good looking guy. What do you want to walk around like that for?

GEORGE: No, I'll put half a can of mousse in my head like you.

(Manny and Harold are arguing again from down the hall)

HAROLD: I told you I don't like these sponges, they're too small! I want a big sponge! (Manny yells) You can't pick up anything with these! There's no absorption!

(Manny yells in Spanish, Jerry exits his apartment)

JERRY: Boys, boys.

HAROLD: Hi, Jerry.

HAROLD: Hello, Jerry. (Says something in Spanish to Harold)

HAROLD: Okay.. your friend can't have the apartment, Jerry.

JERRY: What?

HAROLD: Because somebody offered Manny five thousand dollars for the apartment. I don't want to do it. Manny wants to do it. (Manny yells) Because it's true!

Why shouldn't I tell him?

JERRY: Hey, hey. I understand. You're businessmen. (Manny talks in Spanish)

HAROLD: Oh, now, he says that if your friend has five thousand dollars, we'll give it to her.

JERRY: Well, that's a lot of money. But, if that's the way it's gotta be, that's the way it's gotta be. (Goes back to his apartment) You know, I used to think that the

universe is a random, chaotic, sequence of meaningless events, but I see now that there is reason and purpose to all things.

GEORGE: What happened to you?

JERRY: Religion, my friend, that's what happened to me. Because, I have just been informed that it's going to cost Elaine the sum of five thousand dollars to get the

apartment upstairs.

GEORGE: Five thousand dollars? She doesn't have five thousand dollars!

JERRY: Of course she doesn't have five thousand dollars!

GEORGE: So, she can't get the apartment.

JERRY: Can't get it.

GEORGE: So, she doesn't move in.

JERRY: No move. So, you see, it's all part of a divine plan.

GEORGE: And how does the baldness fit into that plan?

(The intercom buzzes)

JERRY: (Into the intercom) Elaine?

ELAINE: Yeah.

JERRY: (Unlocks the main door. To George) Alright, this is going to require some great acting now. I have to pretend I'm disappointed. You're going to really see

me being a phony, now. I hope you can take this.. maybe you should go in the other room.

GEORGE: Are you kidding?! I lie ever second of the day. My whole life is a sham!

JERRY: 'Cause you know, I love Elaine.

GEORGE: Of course you do.

JERRY: But you know.. not in the building. Really, I feel terrible about this. My intentions were good. What can I do? Tell me..

(Enter Elaine) ELAINE: (To someone in the hallway) No, I'll be seeing you. (Starts to sing) "Good morning, good morning.." Have you ever gotten up in the morning

and felt it's great to be alive? That every breath is a gift of sweet life from above? (George leaves, and goes to the other room) Oh, and before I forget, I have the

checks for first month, last month, security deposit. I have seventy-five dollars left in my account.

JERRY: (Looks at the checks) Well.. there's a little bit of a problem.

ELAINE: Oh, I know. There's a weak shower spray, I know. I've already thought about it, and I'm switching to baths. As Winston Churchill said, "Why stand when

you can sit?" Maybe I'll get some rubber duckies..

JERRY: No, someone offered Harold and Manny five thousand for the apartment. I'm sure they'd just as soon give it to you, but you'd have to come up with that

money.

ELAINE: Five thousand dollars? I don't have five thousand dollars.

JERRY: I know.

ELAINE: How am I going to get five thousand dollars?

JERRY: I have no idea.

(Enter Kramer)

KRAMER: Hey, my new neighbor!

ELAINE: I'm not moving in.

KRAMER: What?

ELAINE: They want five thousand dollars now.

KRAMER: So, okay. What's the problem?

ELAINE: I don't have five thousand dollars.

KRAMER: C'mon, you can come up with five thousand dollars.. Jerry, you don't have five thousand dollars you can led her? Come on.

JERRY: Yeah, well, I didn't.. Is that something you want to borrow?

ELAINE: No, that's too much money to borrow.

KRAMER: Loan her the money. You can afford it.

JERRY: She doesn't want to borrow the money.

KRAMER: Oh, c'mon. She'll pay you back. What's five grand between friends?

ELAINE: Of course I'd pay you back..

KRAMER: Yeah, so what's the problem?

JERRY: Who said there's a problem?

KRAMER: He said he'd loan you the money.

ELAINE: Well Jerry, it might take a while for me to pay you back. Maybe a few years. How do you feel about that?

KRAMER: That's okay. He doesn't care.

ELAINE: You know, money can sometimes come between friends.

KRAMER: Get outta here.

ELAINE: Let me think about it.

KRAMER: What's to think about?

ELAINE: I don't know.. I don't know. Five thousand.. let me just take one more look at it. (Leaves)

JERRY: It was all over! Taken care of. Done! Finished. Five thousand.. Where's she gonna get five thousand? She doesn't have five thousand. Clean. Good bye.

She's gone. Then you come in, "Why don't you loan her five thousand? What do you care? You've got five thousand. Give her five thousand."

KRAMER: You didn't want her in the building?

JERRY: No, I didn't!

KRAMER: Well, then what did you loan her the five thousand for? Oh, look, maybe she won't take it.. I mean, she did say that she was going to think about it.

JERRY: People don't turn down money! It's what separates us from the animals.

KRAMER: I still don't understand what the problem is having her in the building.

JERRY: Let me explain something to you.. You see, you're not normal. You're a great guy, I love you, but you're a pod. I, on the other hand, am a human being. I

sometimes feel awkward, uncomfortable, even inhibited in certain situations with the other human beings. You wouldn't understand.

KRAMER: Because I'm a pod?

(George returns for Jerry's bedroom just as Elaine returns)

ELAINE: I'll take it!

(George turns on his heels, and goes back into Jerry's room)

(Scene ends)

[Setting: Roxanne's apartment]

(Guests are milling around, eating. Elaine enters with Jerry and George. Roxanne greets them)

ROXANNE: Hi, Elaine..

ELAINE: Oh, hi, Roxanne. Nice to be here. These are my friends. This is George, and this is Jerry. (They exchange greetings) Jerry's the one who got me my new

apartment!

ROXANNE: So, you're Elaine's hero.

JERRY: Yeah, it's my life's work.

ROXANNE: There are so few true heros left in this world. (Jerry's attracted to Roxanne, Elaine notices)

GEORGE: (Showing off his wedding band) Yeah, my wife couldn't make it today. She's got some thing with her mother.. Who know's what going on with her. Don't

let any one kid you, it's tough. (Goes off to mingle)

JERRY: Well, better load up on some carbos before the race. (Starts selecting food from the tables)

ROXANNE: Oh, the marathon is great, isn't it?

JERRY: Oh, yes. Particularily if your not in it.

ROXANNE: I wish we had a view of the finish line.

JERRY: What's to see? A woman from Norway, a guy from Kenya, and twenty thousand losers.

(Roxanne makes a face, Scene guts to George. He's standing next to an attractive woman)

GEORGE: ..Yeah, my wife started getting on me about the lawn today. I'm tellin' ya, it's one thing after another.

RITA: Is she here?

GEORGE: No, she's working.

RITA: What does she do?

GEORGE: She's an.. entymologist - you know, bees, flies, gnats. What about you?

RITA: I work for the Director of Madison Square Garden. It's great! I can get free tickets to any sporting even in New York. (George is stunned) Anyway, she's a

very luck woman.

GEORGE: But.. (She leaves, George is standing there)

(Scene cuts to an entering man and woman)

ROXANNE: Hi Stan. Joanne.

ELAINE: Jerry, this is Joanne, and this is Stan. They're in my short story class with Roxanne and me. Hey, Jerry just got me a great apartment in his building!

JOANNE: Well, Jerry, it'll be nice having a close friend nearby?

JERRY: Fantastic..

STAN: She can pop in whenever she wants.

JERRY: I know.

JOANNE: She doesn't even need to knock!

JERRY: It's tremendous.

STAN: Anytime of day.

JERRY: I'm in heaven.

ELAINE: Oh, Rita come here. This is Jerry. He's the one who got me the apartment.

RITA: Oh, Hi. (Calling to someone) bob, this is the guy who got Elaine the apartment.

(Scene cuts to George)

GEORGE: I'm sorry, I don't see the big deal about being a matador. The bull charges, you move the cape, wha't so hard? (The both laugh flirtingly)

SUSIE: So, are you really married? Because, I've actually heard of single guys who wear wedding bands to attrack women.

GEORGE: You'd have to be a real loser to try something like that.

SUSIE: That's too bad, because I really have a thing for bald guys with glasses. (Shrugs, smiles, then leaves George)

RITA: Hey everybody! Here come the runners!

(Everyone runs to the windows. Jerry and Elaine stay put)

ELAINE: So you and Roxanne are hitting it off, huh?

JERRY: Oh, I wouldn't quite say that.

ELAINE: Really? From a distance, you seemed to be coming on to her.

JERRY: I'm a guy.. it always looks like that.

ELAINE: Because, I was thinking.. are you at all concerned that living in the same building will, y'kno.. cramp our styles?

JERRY: Na..

ELAINE: Because, I was worried that there might be a situation in which one of us come home with somebody, it could get a little uncomfortable. But - as long as

you're okay with it, it's fine with me.

(Scene cuts to George)

JANICE: I've never been able to be with just one person. I can, however, carry on strictly physical relationships which can last for years and years. It's a shame

you're married..

GEORGE: (Frantically tries to take the ring off) I'm not. It's just a sociological experiment!

JANICE: Please.. (Walks away)

(Jerry walks over to George)

JERRY: You have no idea what an idiot it. Elaine just gave me a chance to get out and I didn't take it. (Points to himself) This is an idiot.

GEORGE: Is that right? (Showing him up) I just threw away a lifetime of guilt-free sex and floor seats for ever sporting event in Madison Square Garden. So please,

a little respect. For I am Costanza. Lord of the Idiots!

ROXANNE: (Yelling out the window) You're all winners!

GEORGE: But suddenly, a new contender has emerged..

(Scene ends)

[Setting: Jerry's apartment]

JERRY: (Into the phone) George, I didn't sleep at all last night.. I decided I have to tell her.. I'm just going to be honest. That's all.. Yes, I'm nervous.. Are you

listening to me? Just put some soap on your finger.. it'll slide right off.. Then try axle grease. (Kramer enters) I'll call you back after I talk to her. Bye.

KRAMER: Well, it's all taken care of. Everything's cool.

JERRY: What? What's cool?

KRAMER: Elaine.

JERRY: What are you talking about?

KRAMER: I just found a guy who's willing to pay ten thousand dollars for the apartment.

JERRY: You what?! Get out! Ten thousand?

KRAMER: (Nods) Cash.

JERRY: Who would pay that much?

KRAMER: He's in the music business.

JERRY: Elaine would never borrow that much money! (Hugs Kramer, then grabs him by the cheeks) Kramer, my God, man! This is beautiful! I think I'm in the clear

here. Elaine's not moving in! I don't have to confront her! She has no idea I never wanted her to move in.. I"m golden!

KRAMER: Well, occasionally, I like to help the humans.

(Scene ends)

[Setting: Jerry's apartment]

(Harold and Manny are in Jerry's apartment. A pulsing music is coming through the walls)

ELAINE: Wow. You're right. That is loud.

JERRY: It's just unbelievable.

ELAINE: They rehearse all the time?

JERRY: All the time. I've been up there six times. They refuse to stop. I can't live like this. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I'm heading for breakdown! (To Harold)

Can't you do something?

HAROLD: I'm not going up. It stinks up there.

JERRY: Manny..

MANNY: (In Spanish) They're allowed to play until eleven o' clock.

HAROLD: I'm not the one who said eleven o' clock. He makes up his own rules.

ELAINE: Boy, too bad. If I was up there, you'd never hear a peep out of me. I'm as quiet as a mouse.

(Kramer enters)

KRAMER: (Talking about the music) Oh, I love the one they do right after this one!

(Scene ends)

[Setting: Night club]

JERRY: I don't know. What do you do when a neighbor is making, like, a lot of noise at three o' clock in the morning? I mean, can you knock on someone's door

and tell them to keep it down? You're really altering your whole self-image, I mean, what am I? Fred Mertz now? What's happening to me? Can I do this? Am I a

shusher? I used to be a shushee. There's a lot of shushing going on in movie theaters. People are always shushing. Shh..shh.... shhh... shhh.. Doesn't work, 'cause

nobody knows where a shush is coming from. They just hear a Shh. "Was that a shush? I think somebody just shushed me." Some people you can't shush in a movie

theater. There's always that certain group of people, isn't it. They're talking and talking, and everyone around them is shushing them, and shushing them. They won't

shush. They're the unshushables.



[Setting: Night club]

JERRY: I have to tell you that I did some very exciting news recently, and I don't know if I should really tell you exactly what it is because it's really not a definite thing yet. Well, I will tell you what I know so far. According to the information that I have in the envelope that I've received, it seems that I may have already won some very valuable prizes. Well, thank you, thank you very much, well thank you. It's very nice to hear that. But, in all honesty, I have to say, I didn't even know I was in this thing. But, according to the readout, it looks like I am among the top people that they are considering. You know, that's what annoys me about the sweepstakes companies, they always tease you with that, "You may have already won." I'd like once for a sweepstakes company to have some guts, come out with the truth, just tell people the truth one time. Send out envelopes, "You have definitely lost!" You turn it over, giant printing, "Not even close!" You open it up, there's this whole letter of explanation, "Even we cannot believe how badly you've done in this contest."

(Scene ends)
[Setting: Jerry's apartment]

(George is reading the paper. Kramer and Jerry both try to enter carrying a large carton with the name Seinfeld on it)

JERRY: (Trying to get the box through the door. To Kramer) To the right. (They get it through)

GEORGE: That took awhile.

JERRY: (Sarcastic) Don't get up.

GEORGE: I'd like to help, but my neck..

(The set the box on the table)

GEORGE: So how long has it been in the basement?

JERRY: Since my grandfather died. I was suppose to send it down to my parents in Florida, but they didn't want it. They told me to get rid of it, but I felt funny and then I sort of forgot about it. And it's been sitting down there for three years.. until he saw it. (To Kramer) Alright, so, just take what you want and let's get it out of here.

(They open the box, and start going through it)

GEORGE: What's in it?

JERRY: Grandpa clothes. I can't wear them.

KRAMER: (Pulls out some socks) You want these? Knee socks. You don't wear knee socks.

JERRY: No, go ahead. (Looks around his apartment) Look at this place. I can't wait to get it cleaned.

GEORGE: I know someone who'll do it. She's good. She's honest.

JERRY: No, Elaine got this writer friend from Finland, Rava. Her boyfriend goes to Columbia grad school, and he's suppose to do it.

GEORGE: Students can't clean. It's anathema. (Jerry's confused) ..They don't like it.

JERRY: How long have you been waiting to squeeze that into a conversation?

(Kramer pulls a statue out of the box)

KRAMER: Now this, I like.

(George's eyes light up when he sees the statue)

GEORGE: Wait a second. I can't believe this! Let me see this.

KRAMER: (Getting possesive) Wait, wait, wait..

GEORGE: Let me just see it.

KRAMER: Come on..

(The both grab it)

GEORGE: Let me just see it for a second. Oh my God, it's exactly the same!

JERRY: What?

GEORGE: When I was ten years old, my parents had this very same statue on the mantle of our apartment. Exactly. And, one day, I grabbed it, and I was using it as a microphone. I was singing, "MacArthur Park", and I got to the part about, "I'll never have that recipe again," and it slipped out of my hand and it broke. My parents looked at me like I smashed the ten commandments. To this day, they bring it up. It was the single most damaging experience in my life, aside from seeing my father naked.

(George grips the statue, but Kramer wont let go. They start to fight for it)

KRAMER: C'mon, George. I saw it first.

GEORGE: No, Kramer. I have to have this statue.

KRAMER: No, I got dibs!

GEORGE: What? No dibs! I need this statue. C'mon, give it!

JERRY: (Stepping in) Spread out, spread out you numbskulls. Why don't you just settle it like mature adults?

KRAMER: Potato man!

GEORGE: No, no, no potato man.. Inka-dink.

(Kramer and George both visibly add up in their heads to see who would lose if Inka-Dink was the way to go)

KRAMER: Okay.. start with me.

GEORGE: Yeah, good, good.

(Jerry begins the childish choosing game of Inka-dink, pointing alternately between Kramer and George with every syllable)

JERRY: Inka-dink, a bottle of ink. The cork fell out, and you stink. Not because you're dirty, not because you're clean - just because you kissed the girl behind the magazine.. (He lands on Kramer, then completes the rhyme) And you are it! (Lands on George)

KRAMER: What?! Wait a minute. No, no, no. What are you doing? No, no, oh, oh, okay. He's out. I get it.

GEORGE: No, no, no, no.. I'm "it". I win.

JERRY: No, he's it. He wins. "It" is good.

KRAMER: Do over - start with him.

JERRY: No, no, no, come on, Kramer. Now, you got the socks.

(Kramer tosses the statue to George)

KRAMER: Alright, you can have it. Okay, I'm gonna take the suit, and the shoes, and the hat.

JERRY: Alright, c'mon. Let's go.

KRAMER: Hey, I'll look like Joe Friday in Dragnet. (Hums out the theme song)

GEORGE: (In shock) I can't believe I won at Inka-dink.

JERRY: Come on, let's go. (They go to the door. George sets the statue down) Aren't you gonna take it?

GEORGE: No, no, no, I don't want to carry it around all night. I'll pick it up later.

GOERGE: (To Kramer) What about your stuff?

KRAMER: Oh, uh, well - okay. (Balls up the clothes he just got, and throws them into his apartment, and leaves)

JERRY: Alright, let's go. Hey, you know, you owe me one.

GEORGE: What?

JERRY: The Inka-dink.. you were "It".

GEORGE: "It"'s bad?

JERRY: "It" very bad.

(Scene ends)
[Setting: Jerry's apartment]

RAVA: Well, if they don't let you be my editor on this book, I'll go to another publisher. It's that simple.

ELAINE: You told them that?

RAVA: Of course.

ELAINE: This is so fantastic. I don't know how to thank you.

(Jerry enters for the bedroom carrying luggage)

JERRY: (Frantic) So, where's this boyfriend of yours? I can't wait much longer. I've got a flight.

ELAINE: Oh, probably caught in traffic.

RAVA: (Serious) Or maybe he's dead.

JERRY: (Joking) So what do you write, children's books?

(There's a knock at the door)

RAVA: That's Ray.

(Ray enters with cleaning gear)

RAY: Ah, greetings, greetings, and salutations. I beg your forgiveness. My tardiness was unavoidable. Rava, my love. Elaine, my dear friend.. And you must be Jerry. Lord of the manor. Ah, my liege. A pleasure to serve you. (Bows)

JERRY: (Taken aback) ..Alright.

RAVA: And we have to get back to work. (She exits with Elaine)

JERRY: (Rushed) I gotta get to the airport.

RAY: Your place shall sparkle like the stars in heaven upon your save arrival, Sire.

JERRY: The toilet brush is under the sink.. (Exits)

(Scene ends)
[Setting: Night club]

JERRY: I don't really feel that comfortable with a maid, either, because there's that guilt when you have someone cleaning your house. You know, you're sitting there on your sofa, and they go by with the vacuum, "I'm really sorry about this. I don't know why I let that stuff over there." And that's why I could never be a maid, because I'd have an attitude. I'd find them, whereever they are in the house, "Oh, I suppose you couldn't do this? No, don't get up, let me clean up your filth. No, you couldn't dust. No, this is too tough, isn't it?"

(Scene ends)
[Setting: Jerry's apartment]

JERRY: He really did an amazing job, look! He uncoagulated the top of the dishwashing liquid. (Opens refrigerator) He cleaned out the bottom of the little egg cups. Come here, look at this. (Gets on his knees) He cleaned the little one-inch area between the refrigerator and the counter. How did he get in there? He must be like Rubber Man!

ELAINE: There's no Rubber Man.

JERRY: ..Why did I think there was a Rubber Man? There's Elastic Man and Plastic Man.

ELAINE: I'm leaving.

JERRY: Where are you going?

ELAINE: To Rava's house. I've gotta pick up her manuscript.

JERRY: Wait. I'll go with you. (They both go tward the door. Jerry opens it) Elaine, he Windexed the little peep hole! (The leave)

(Scene ends)
[Setting: Rava's apartment]

(Jerry, Elaine, and Rava sit in the living room)

ELAINE: (To Rava) So, the meeting with Lippman is all set. He's the editor-in-chief! I think because of your request..

RAVA: Demand. (The sound of locks being unlocked can be heard) There's Ray.. late as usual.

(Ray enters)

RAY: Well, this is an unexpected surprise - and Delight! The once and future king of comedy, "Jerry the First," gracing our humble abode. Rava, we're in the presence of royalty.

JERRY: Hey, Ray, listen, you really did a tremendous job cleaning that apartment.

RAY: But I didn't just clean your apartment. It was a ritual, a ceremony, a celebration of life.

JERRY: (Joking about his personality) Shouldn't you be out on a ledge somewhere?

(They all laugh - Ray laughs longer than everyone else. Jerry savors the laughs of his big fan - then he sees George's statue on the mantle of the fireplace. He's stunned by the sight)

RAVA: The water is boiling. Are you having tea?

ELAINE AND RAY: Yes.

(Jerry's still stunned)

ELAINE: Jerry? ..Jerry!

JERRY: (Snaps out of it) What?

RAVA: (From the kitchen) Ray, would you give me a hand?

RAY: Yeah, I'm coming!

(He leaves. As soon as both Rava and Ray are in the kitchen, Jerry and Elaine start talking in loud whispers)

JERRY: (Points to the statue) I think that's the statue from my house. That looks like the statue from my house!

ELAINE: What statue?

JERRY: I had a statue!

ELAINE: You have a statue? I never saw a statue.

JERRY: My grandfather gave me a statue!

ELAINE: Since when?

JERRY: What's the difference?! That's the one! He ripped me off! This guy ripped me off!

(Ray pops his head back into the living room)

RAY: Do you take sugar?

JERRY AND ELAINE: Uhh.. no.

(Ray goes back into the kitchen)

JERRY: I can't believe it! This guy ripped me off!

ELAINE: Do you realize what you're saying?

JERRY: Yes! This guy ripped me off! He stole that statue right out of my house!

(Ray pops in again)

RAY: Lemon?

JERRY AND ELAINE: (Causual) Uh.. sure, yeah..

(Ray goes back into the kitchen)

ELAINE: Are you sure?

JERRY: Pretty sure! Ninety-nine percent sure.

ELAINE: Ninety-nine percent sure?!

(Ray and Rava both enter, carrying a tray of tea)

RAY: Ah, sweet elixir. It's fragrant nectar - a soothing balm for the soul.

(Jerry smells it suspiciously - like it's poisoned. A ding from the kitchen can be heard)

RAY: The pastries!

(Ray and Rava exit in different directions)

ELAINE: Maybe it just looks the same. Maybe it's just a coincidence.

JERRY: Coincidence? This guy's in my apartment and then, just by coincidence, he has the same exact statue in his apartment.

ELAINE: I never saw the statue.

JERRY: I had a statue! What should I do?

ELAINE: I don't know.

JERRY: ..I'll call Kramer. He can check my house. (Grabs the phone, and dials)

ELAINE: Oh Jerry, don't blow this for me.

JERRY: Don't worry.. (Whispering into the phone) Kramer! Kramer!.. It's Jerry!.. Jerry! .. from next door!.. Never mind where I am!.. Yes, Jerry Seinfeld!.. (Rava enters with a manuscript. Jerry starts talking casually)

Jerry: Ma, I told ya, just dip the bread in the batter, and put in right in the pan. Okay, bye. (Hangs up) My mother.. She forgot how to make French Toast. You know how mothers are.

RAVA: My mother left us when I was six years old. All seven of us. He ever heard from her again. I hope she's rotting in an alley somewhere.

(A long beat passes)

JERRY: My mom's down in Florida.. she's go one of those condos.. Hot down there in the summer. You ever been down there?

(Ray enters with a tray of pastries)

RAY: I love these pastries. You know, in Scandinavian mythology, the pastries were the food of the gods.

JERRY: ..Listen, I just remembered.. I'm ..uh, getting a facial.

ELAINE: (Takes the manuscript) Oh, see you tomarrow morning.

(They go to leave)

RAY: Oh, how about dinner?

JERRY: No, I don't eat dinner. Dinner's for suckers. (They leave)

(Scene ends)
[Setting: Jerry's apartment]

JERRY: (On the phone) Uh huh.. yeah.. Okay, thanks anyway. Bye. (Hangs up) Nope, the cop says it's my word against his. There's nothing they can do.

KRAMER: Let's go get him.

JERRY: Yeah, right.

GEORGE: We can't just let him get away with this.

JERRY: Do you realize how crazy he had to be to do something like this? He knew I was gonna know it's missing, and he took it! And of all things to take - I left my watch, tape recorder, stereo. He's crazy.

KRAMER: You wanta go get him?

ELAINE: Well, then, if he's crazy you should just forget it.

GEORGE: Forget it? I already called my parents. I told them to expect the surprise of a lifetime. My mother's making her roasted potatoes!

ELAINE: George, do you realize that Rava's asked me to edit her book?

GEORGE: Who is this Rava?

KRAMER: I say we get him.

ELAINE: No!

GEORGE: Let me just call him.

JERRY: I'll call him. (Picks up the cordless phone. Kramer, George, and Elaine all struggle for control of the other - so they can listen in on the conversation. As Jerry's talking, the three others still fight) Hello, Ray? ..Hi, Ray, this is Rava's friend, Elaine's frined, Jerry.. The King of Comedy.. right. Listen, you know that statue on your mantle, the one with the blue lady? (To Kramer and George) Will you shut up?! (To Ray) Yeah, you don't want to talk about it over the phone? You don't want Rava to hear? ..Yeah, I understand.. You know that coffee shop near my house, Monk's? ..Alright, tomarrow. One o' clock. Great, okay, bye. (Hangs up)

ELAINE: (Scrambling) Alright, look, look, look, Let's say he stole it.

GEORGE: Oh, he stole it?

ELAINE: C'mon, you can't do anything about it. The cops won't do anything. What, are you going to fight him? Why don't you just.. forget it?

JERRY AND GEORGE: No.

(Scene ends)
[Setting: Coffee shop]

(Jerry sits alone. In the next booth to Jerry's back, George is sitting inconspicuously)

GEORGE: (To Jerry, without looking at him) I thought you said one o' clock.

JERRY: Relax, he's late. He's always late. It's part of his "M.O."

GEORGE: Remember, don't take any crap.

JERRY: Yeah, yeah.. don't worry about it.

GEORGE: I'll be right here.

(Ray enters)

JERRY: (Sarcastic) That's comforting.. Shh. He's here. (Greeting him) Ray?

RAY: (Stands next to the table) Oh, Jerry. I can't believe you asked me about that statue. Do you know how much trouble you could've got me into?

JERRY: ..Well, I didn't..

RAY: Rava was standing right next to me. I never told her where I got the statue.

GEORGE: (Muttering to himself) I wonder why.

JERRY: Well, just give it back, and I won't say anything.

RAY: Give it back?

JERRY: Yeah.

RAY: What are you talking about?

JERRY: What are you talking about?

GEORGE: (Muttering) What is he talking about..

RAY: I'm talking about the statue.

JERRY: Yeah, me too.

RAY: Give it back to whom?

JERRY: Me.

GEORGE: (To himself) Yeah, him.

RAY: You?

JERRY: Yeah. Me.

RAY: I'm not getting this.

GEORGE: (To himself) You already got it.

JERRY: Ray, I had a statue in my house. You were in my house - and then I saw it in your house.

RAY: What are you saying?

JERRY: What am I saying?

GEORGE: (To himself) Take a wild guess.

RAY: Are you saying I stole your statue?

GEORGE: (To himself) What a mind.

JERRY: Well, I..

RAY: I can't believe what I'm hearing.

JERRY: I can't believe what I'm hearing.

GEORGE: (to himself) I can't believe what I'm hearing.

RAY: For your information, I got that statue at a pawn shop.

GEORGE: (To Himself) A pawn shop?

JERRY: A pawn shop?

RAY: Yes. In Chinatown with the money I earned cleaning people's apartments.

GEORGE: (To himself) And cleaning them out.

(Jerry elbows George - a message to shut up)

JERRY: Oh, excuse me.. Look, Ray, you were the only person in my house.

RAY: What's behind this? It's Rava, isn't it?

GEORGE: (To himself) Again with the Rava.

RAY: You want her.

JERRY: (Joking) No, she's a little too cheery for me.

RAY: (Losing it) She's from Finland, for crying out loud. Finland! Do you understand?!

JERRY: I know Finland. They're neutral.

RAY: Is it me? Do I rub you the wrong way?

JERRY: No, I actually find you quite charming.. a bit verbose at times.

GEORGE: (Mocking) "Oh, I find you so charming" ..You wuss.

JERRY: (To George) Did you call me a wuss?

RAY: What did you say?

JERRY: I said luss.. I'm at a luss..

RAY: I would just love to take you down to the shop where I got it.

JERRY: That's not necessary. (George slams his menu down on the table in anger) You know, maybe it's not that bad an idea.

RAY: And I would love to. Nothing would please me more. But, unfortunately, the guy retired and moved to Singapore.

GEORGE: (Muttering to himself) Singapore?! Do you hear this?

RAY: If you really want, maybe I can contact the guy in Singapore aand have him make a photostat of the receipt and send it over.

GEORGGE: That's it! That's it! I can't take it. I can't take it anymore! (Gets up, turns around, and confronts Ray) You stole the statue! You're a theif! You're a liar!

JERRY: (Pleading) George.

RAY: (To Jerry) Who is this?

GEORGE: I'm the judge and the jury, pal. And the verdict is.. guilty!

RAY: What's going on here?

GEORGE: GUILTY!

RAY: Your friend is crazy.

GEORGE: Oh, I'm crazy!

JERRY: (Still pleading) George, george..

RAY: I've got to get going. I have a class.

GEORGE: Oh ho! Class, huh? At Columbia? Let me tell you something, pal. I called the registrar's office. I checked you out. They have no record of a Ray Thomas at that school! You liar!

RAY: Well, that's because I'm registered under my full legal name, Raymond Thomas Wochinski. Ray Thomas is my professional name.

GEORGE: You mean alias.

RAY: You are starting to make me angry.

GEORGE: Well, that was bound to happen!

RAY: (To Jerry) I hope you think about what you've done here today.. and if you want to call and apologize, you know where to reach me. (Goes to leave)

JERRY: Hey, Ray.

RAY: (Stops) Yes?

JERRY: How did you get the goop out of the top of the dishwashing liquid? It was like a brand-new nozzle!

(Scene ends)
[Setting: Pendant publishing]

(Elaine and Rava are waiting for an elevator)

ELAINE: Nervous?

RAVA: Why should I be?

ELAINE: Yeah. Right.

RAVA: Your notes are very insightful.

ELAINE: The book is great. Did you go out last night?

RAVA: No. We made love on the floor like two animals. Ray is insatiable.

ELAINE: They all are..

RAVA: Was Jerry?

ELAINE: I can't remember..

(Doors open. They step in)

RAVA: You know, Ray is very upset over these accusations.

ELAINE: Oh, well, I'm staying out of this one. This is between them. I am not getting involved.

(The doors close. Scene cuts to moments later, on another floor. The doors open)

RAVA: (Annoyed) So you think he stole it?!

ELAINE: Well, you have to admit.. the circumstantial evidence.

RAVA: I admit nothing!

(The doors close. Scene cuts to the inside of the elevator)

MAN: Will you put that cigarette out, please?

(Rava ignores him)

ELAINE: Well, I mean, he was in the apartment, and then it's gon and it's in your apartment.

RAVA: Maybe you think we're in cahoots.

ELAINE: No, no.. but it is quite a coincidence.

RAVA: Yes, that's all, a coincidence!

ELAINE: A big coincidence.

RAVA: Not a big coincidence. A coincidence!

ELAINE: No, that's a big coincidence.

RAVA: That's what a coincidence is! There are no small coincidences and big coincidences!

ELAINE: No, there are degrees of coincidences.

RAVA: No, there are only coincidences! ..Ask anyone! (Enraged, she asks everone in the elevator) Are there big coincidences and small coincidences, or just coincidences? (Silent) ..Well?! Well?!..

(Everyone just kinda shrugs, then murmurs. The doors open)

MAN: Will you put that cigarette out?!

RAVA: (Pointing the lit end at him) Maybe I put it out on your face! (To Elaine) It's just like Ray said - you and Jerry are jealous of our love. You're trying to destroy us.

ELAINE: Shouldn't you be out on a ledge somewhere?

(The doors close. Scene cuts to another floor. The elevator is empty except for Elaine. There's a janitor's cart parked right outside the doors. She steps out, then throws the manuscript into the garbage can of the cart, and exits)

(Scene ends)
[Setting: Jerry's apartment]

GEORGE: (On the phone) Ma, will you stop?.. It's just a statue! How is it my fault?! ..It was stolen. I didn't even touch it this time.. Okay, fine. I don't se why this should affect to potatoes! Okay. Goodbye. (Hangs up) She doesn't react to disappointement very well.. unlike me.

KRAMER: I'm not happy about this.

ELAINE: Why don't we just throw a Molotov cocktail through their window?

GEORGE: There's just no justice. This experience has changed me. It's made me more cynical, more bitter, more jaded.

JERRY: Really?

GEORGE: (Casually) Sure. Why not?

ELAINE: Well, how do you think I feel? Instead of editing the first novel of a major young writing talent, I am proofreading a food allergy cookbook.

JERRY: Can't you talk to your boss?

ELAINE: I did. He loves Rava.. worse.. he loves Ray, and he doesn't think you're funny at all.

KRAMER: I'm not happy about this.

JERRY: Well, perhaps we can take comfort in the knowledge that in the next world, Ray will be the recipient of a much larger and more harsh brand of justice..

GEORGE: Yeah.. He'll have my parents!

(Scene ends)
[Setting: Rava and Ray's apartment]

(Ray's home alone. There's a knock at the door)

KRAMER: Police! Open up!

RAY: Police? (Opens the door a crack - Kramer barges in like a cop. He's wearing Jerry's grandfather's suit and hat. He forces Ray against the wall - face first)

KRAMER: Freeze, mother!

RAY: Hey..

(Kramer shoves him roughly against the wall)

KRAMER: Shut up. Spread 'em. I said spread 'em! (Looks around) You're in big trouble son. Burglary, grand larceny, possession of stolen goods.. and uh, uh.. murder.

RAY: Murder?!

(Kramer shoves him against the wall)

KRAMER: Shut up! Keep 'em spread! Just make love to that wall, pervert!

RAY: I think you have me confused with somebody else.

KRAMER: (Afraid he's got the wrong guy) Is your name Ray?

RAY: Yeah.

KRAMER: (Assured) Yeah, you're the punk I'm looking for. (Grabs the statue from the mantle, and puts it in his bag)

RAY: Hey, hey, are you a cop?

KRAMER: Yeah, I'm a cop. I'm a good cop. I'm a damn good cop! Today's your lucky day, junior, 'cause I'm gonna let you off with a warning. Any more of this criminal activity, and you'll be sorry. You got me?

RAY: Got you? I don't even know what the hell you're talking about.

KRAMER: Good. Good. Let's keep it that way. (Exits)

(Scene ends)
[Setting: Jerry's apartment]

(Kramer guides Jerry, Elaine, and George into the apartment)

JERRY: Alright, alright. What's the big hubbub, bub?

(Kramer runs to his apartment, then returns with a duffel bag. He places it on the table, and reveals the statue)

GEORGE: Kramer, I can't believe it. Oh, you're my hero!

KRAMER: Yeah.

JERRY: Kramer, what did you do?

KRAMER: Well, let's put it this way: I didn't take him to People's Court.

GEORGE: I feel like a huge weight's been lifted off my shoulders. (Giddily) I.. I.. I feel happy! Kramer, I don't know how to thank you!

KRAMER: Well, I'll think of something.. (Slaps George on the back - sending the statue crashing to the ground)

(Scene ends)
[Setting: Night club]

JERRY: People are going to steal from you. You can't stop them. But, everybody has their own little personal security things - things that they think will foil the crooks, you know? In your own mind, right? ..You go to the beach, go in the water, put your wallet in the sneaker. Who's gonna know? What criminal mind could penetrate this fortress of security? I tied a bow. They can't get through that. I put the wallet down by the toe of the sneaker. They never look there. They check the heel, they move on.

END OF SHOW.

LEVITAN: Remind me to tell you what we did in Lake George. [laughing] Get

this...I got it all on video. [laughing]

GEORGE: That's it. This is it. I'm done. Through. It's over. I'm gone.

Finished. Over. I will never work for you again. Look at you.

[laughing] You think you're an important man? Is that what you think? You

are a laughingstock. You are a joke. These people are laughing at

you. You're nothing! You have no brains, no ability, nothing! [knocking

object over on desk] I quit!



KRAMER: Hey.

JERRY: Hey.

KRAMER: Boy, I have really had it with Newman. He wakes me up again last

night at three o'clock in the morning to tell me he's going up onto the

roof to kill himself.

JERRY: Well, what'd you say?

KRAMER: I said " Jump." Well, he's been threatening to do this for years. I

said " Look, if you're gonna kill yourself do it already and stop

bothering me." At least I'd respect the guy for accomplishing something.

JERRY: What's his problem?

KRAMER: No job. No women.

JERRY: He called the right guy.

KRAMER: What am I supposed to tell him? How much there is for him to live

for? Why should I lie to him?

JERRY: All right, I'm leaving. I going to the laundry.

KRAMER: Why don't you use the machines down in the basement?

JERRY: Fluff and fold. The only way to live. [snapping fingers in tune with

words] I drop it off. I pick it up. It's a delight.

KRAMER: How 'bout if I put a few things --

JERRY: Wait a sec. I don't wanna do --

KRAMER: Well, you're going over there.

JERRY: I don't wanna mix in everything! My guys don't know your guys. You

can't just lock 'em all in the same machine together. They'll start a

riot.

KRAMER: Have you ever met my guys?

JERRY: No. I can't say as I have.

KRAMER: Well!

JERRY: All right. Put 'em on top.

KRAMER: Ah!



JERRY: Oh, beautiful. This stuff on top is my friends'. Could I get it done

in a separate machine?

VIC: I'll have to charge you for another machine.

JERRY: Whatever it costs. In fact, I would prefer it if the machines are

not even touching each other. Because something could, you know, jump

across.

GEORGE: Guess what.

JERRY: How did you know I was here?

GEORGE: Kramer. Guess what.

JERRY: I don't know.

GEORGE: I quit my job.

JERRY: Get outta here.

GEORGE: I couldn't take it anymore.

VIC: You can have this on Monday.

JERRY: What happened? Levitan?

GEORGE: I go in to use his private bathroom, everybody uses it, and then I

get a memo - a memo - telling me to use the men's room in the hall.

Well, [laughing] we share it with Pace Electronics. It's disgusting!

JERRY: You and your toilets.

GEORGE: I snapped! It was the last straw. [sighs]

JERRY: So, what are you gonna do now? Are you gonna look for something else

in real estate?

GEORGE: Nobody's hiring now. The market's terrible.

JERRY: So what are you gonna do?

GEORGE: I like sports. I could do something in sports.

JERRY: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. In what capacity?

GEORGE: You know, like the general manager of a baseball team or something.

JERRY: Yeah. Well, that - that could be tough to get.

GEORGE: Well, it doesn't even have to be the general manager. Maybe I could

be like, an announcer. Like a caller man. You know how I always make

those interesting comments during the game.

JERRY: Yeah. Yeah. You make good comments.

GEORGE: What about that?

JERRY: Well, they tend to give those jobs to ex-ballplayers and people that

are, you know, in broadcasting.

GEORGE: Well, that's really not fair.

JERRY: I know. Well, okay. Okay. What else do ya like?

GEORGE: Movies. I like to watch movies.

JERRY: Yeah. Yeah.

GEORGE: Do they pay people to watch movies?

JERRY: Projectionists.

GEORGE: That's true.

JERRY: But you gotta know how to work the projector.

GEORGE: Right.

JERRY: And it's probably a union thing.

GEORGE: [scoffs] Those unions. [sighs] Okay. Sports,...movies. What about a

talk show host?

JERRY: Talk show host. That's good.

GEORGE: I think I'd be good at that. I talk to people all the time. Someone

even told me once they thought I'd be a good talk show host.

JERRY: Really?

GEORGE: Yeah. A couple of people. I don't get that, though. Where do you

start?

JERRY: Well, that's where it gets tricky.

GEORGE: You can't just walk into a building and say " I wanna be a talk

show host."

JERRY: I wouldn't think so.

GEORGE: It's all politics.

JERRY: All right. Okay. Sports, movies, talk show host. What else?

GEORGE: This could have been a huge mistake.

JERRY: Well, it doesn't sound like you completely thought this through.

GEORGE: [sighs] What should I do?

JERRY: Maybe you can just go back.

GEORGE: Go back?

JERRY: Yeah. Pretend like it never happened.

GEORGE: You mean just walk into the staff meeting on Monday morning like it

never happened?

JERRY: Sure. You're an emotional person. People don't take you seriously.

GEORGE: Just..go back. Pretend the whole thing never happened.

JERRY: Never happened.

GEORGE: I was just blowin' off a little steam. So what?

JERRY: So what? You're entitled.

GEORGE: I'm emotional.

JERRY: That's right. You're emotional.

GEORGE: Never happened.

JERRY: Never happened.



GEORGE: How ya doin'?

GLENDA: What are you doing here?

GEORGE: What? I work here.

GLENDA: I thought you quit.

GEORGE: What quit? [laughing] Who quit?

DAN: Bill, how was your weekend?

BILL: Oh, excellent weekend. What about your weekend?

DAN: Fine weekend.

GEORGE: Yeah. Good weekend.

DAN: Went up to the Cape. Took the kids sailing. [laughing] Lisa was a

little scared at first, but that kids' gonna be a good sailor

someday.

GEORGE: Aw, she's gonna be a fine sailor.

LEVITAN: Ava, what happened to you Friday afternoon?

AVA: I got a little tied up.

LEVITAN: I'll bet you did.

[laughter breaks out in boardroom]

LEVITAN: I wanna remind everyone that the tenth anniversary party for Rick

Barr Properties is gonna be Wednesday afternoon at four o'clock in

Lasky's Bar, Madison 48th. I want all of you to be there. This really

means a lot to me. Is that Costanza over there? What are you doing

here?

GEORGE: What?

LEVITAN: Am I crazy, or didn't you quit?

GEORGE: When?

LEVITAN: Friday.

GEORGE: Oh, what? What? That? Are you kidding? I didn't quit. What? You

took that seriously?

LEVITAN: You mean, laughingstock? All that stuff?

GEORGE: Come on. Will you stop it.

LEVITAN: No brains? No ability?

GEORGE: Teasing.

LEVITAN: Okay. I want you outta here.

GEORGE: I don't know where you're getting this from. I....you're serious

aren't you? Oh, [laughing] you see?

LEVITAN: You can't win. You can't beat me. That's why I'm here and you're

there. Because I'm a winner. I'll always be a winner and you'll

always be a loser.

GEORGE: " I'll always be a winner and you'll always be a loser." This is

what he said to me.

JERRY: Well, so that's that.

GEORGE: No. That's not that.

JERRY: That's not that?

GEORGE: No.

JERRY: Well, if that's not that, what is that?

GEORGE: I've got some plans. I got plans.

JERRY: What kind of plans?

GEORGE: What's the difference?

JERRY: You don't wanna tell me?

GEORGE: I'm gonna slip him a mickey.

JERRY: What? In his drink? Are you outta your mind? What? Are you Peter

Lorre?

GEORGE: You don't understand. He's got this big party coming up. He's been

looking forward to this for months. This is gonna destroy the whole

thing.

JERRY: What if you destroy him?

GEORGE: No. No. No. No. No. Don't worry. It's perfectly safe. I researched

it. He'll get a little woozy. He might keel over.

JERRY: Well, wha - what does that do? Big deal.

GEORGE: This is what they would do in the movies! It's a beautiful thing!

It's like a movie! I'm gonna slip him a mickey!

JERRY: You've really gone mental.

GEORGE: Nah.

JERRY: Where are you gonna get this mickey? I can't believe I'm saying

"mickey"!

GEORGE: I got a sauce.

JERRY: You got a mickey sauce?

GEORGE: And Elaine is gonna keep him busy.

JERRY: Elaine? How did you rope her into this?

GEORGE: I told her what a sexist he is. How he cheats on his wife.

JERRY: She knew that.

GEORGE: But she didn't know he doesn't recycle.

JERRY: What is the point of all this?

GEORGE: Revenge.

JERRY: Oh, the best revenge is living well.

GEORGE: There's no chance of that.

JERRY: Did you get your laundry?

KRAMER: Yeah.

JERRY: What's with you?

KRAMER: He jumped.

JERRY: What?

KRAMER: Yeah. Newman jumped.

JERRY: Did he call you last night?

KRAMER: Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

JERRY: What did you say?

KRAMER: I said " Wave to me when you pass my window."

JERRY: Whew. Did he wave?

KRAMER: No! He jumped from the second floor. Mr. Papanickolous saw him from

across the street. He's lying out there faking. See, he's trying to

get back at me.

JERRY: Oh, my god!

KRAMER: What's the matter?

JERRY: Well, on Thursday when I came home I had $1500 on me. For some

reason I decided to hide it in my laundry bag and then I completely

forgot about it...and then I took the laundry in on Friday! Oh, come on,

let's go.

KRAMER: Where? Where?

JERRY: To the Laundromat.

VIC: I never saw it.

KRAMER: Okay. Come on. Give the guy his money. What -- what are you doing?

VIC: Hey, you see that sign right there?

JERRY: Oh, I see. So, you put up a sign so you can do whatever you want?

VIC: I'm not responsible.

JERRY: So, anybody leaves anything here, you can just take it? You have a

license to steal? You are like the James Bond of laundry?

VIC: You ever hear of a bank?

JERRY: Come on. Let's go.

KRAMER: No. You can't let him get away with this.

ELAINE: Which one is he?

GEORGE: That's him over there. The one that looks like a blowfish.

ELAINE: Oh, yeah. I see him.

GEORGE: Yeah. Hey, thanks for doing this.

ELAINE: Why pass up the opportunity to go to prison?

GEORGE: This is by far the most exciting thing I've ever done.

ELAINE: Yeah. It is kind of cool.

GEORGE: First time in my life I've ever gotten back at someone.

ELAINE: I can't believe we're doing this. This is the kind of thing they do

in the movies.

GEORGE: That's exactly what I told Jerry!

ELAINE: Really?

GEORGE: Yes!

[both laughing]

GEORGE: God, I've never felt so alive!

JERRY: Maybe we should call this off.

KRAMER: Come on. What's the big deal? Just gonna put a little concrete in

the washing machine.

JERRY: And what's gonna happen?

KRAMER: Well, it'll gonna mix up with the water, and then by the end of the

cycle it'll be a solid block!

JERRY: If only you could put your mind to something worthwhile. You're like

Lex Luthor.

KRAMER: You keep him busy.

[Kramer, holding heavy bag of concrete in arms, stumbles to machine,

knocking chairs around]

[Kramer plops concrete down onto washing machine]

KRAMER: Whoa!

[lifting bag into the air, Kramer, thrown off balance, stumbles backwards

and slams into dryer]

GEORGE: You go over there -

ELAINE: Yeah.

GEORGE: You start flirting with him and I'll come by and, while you're

keeping him busy, I'll slip it in his drink.

ELAINE: Wouldn't it be easier just to punch him in the mouth?

LEVITAN: Come on! They're terrible. They got no infield.

ELAINE: Oops! 'Scuse me.

LEVITAN: Yeah.

GREENY(?): I'm gonna get some food. You want some?

LEVITAN: Nah.

ELAINE: Hi.

LEVITAN: Hi.

ELAINE: [sneezes]

LEVITAN: God bless you.

ELAINE: Oh! Thank you. Thank you very much. [blowing nose] Really. I mean

that. I am not one of those people who give insincere thank you's. No

sir. No sir. When I thank someone I really thank them. So, thank...

yoooou!

LEVITAN: You're welcome.

ELAINE: People don't say " God bless you " as much as they used to. Have

you noticed that?

LEVITAN: No.

ELAINE: So, I'm going to a nudist colony next week.

LEVITAN: Nudist colony?

ELAINE: Oh, yeah. Yeah. I love nudist colonies. They help me..unwind. Aah!

LEVITAN: [laughing] I'd never been to a nudist colony.

ELAINE: Oh, really? Oh, you should go. They're great. They're great. Of

course, when it's over, it's - it's hard to get used to all this

clothing, you know. So, a lot of times, I'll just lock the door to my

office and I'll just sit there naked.

LEVITAN: Seriously?

ELAINE: Oh, yeah. I usually work naked a...couple hours a day.

GEORGE: [whispering] Glenda, can I ask you a favor? Can I have this seat?

GLENDA: What do you have to sit here for? There are plenty of other seats.

GEORGE: [whispering] I can't explain. It's very important that I sit here.

GLENDA: What are you doing here anyway? I thought you were fired.

GEORGE: [whispering] Okay. Okay. Fine.

ELAINE: I cook naked, I clean....I clean naked, I drive naked. Naked.

Naked. Naked.

LEVITAN: Who are you?

ELAINE: Oh, you don't wanna know, mistah. I'm trouble. Big trouble.

[lid on machine slams shut after Kramer opens it, forcing him to pour

concrete all over machine]

JERRY: What about the gentle cycle? You ever use that?

[opening lid, Kramer begins to contort & flail arms about as a cloud of

concrete covers his face]

JERRY: Do you think it's effeminate for a man to put clothes in a gentle

cycle?

[Kramer emptying bag into machine]

JERRY: What about fine fabrics? How do you deal with that kind of

temperament?

[finished with machine, Kramer walks to corner of room with half-full bag &

drops it on the floor]

[Kramer giving "OK" sign]

[Kramer starting machine & trying to brush the mounds of concrete off of

the machine]

JERRY: What about stone washing? You ever witness one of those? That must

be something.

What? Do they just pummel the jeans with rocks?

[Kramer walks over to where Jerry is standing, his entire body covered with

dry concrete]

KRAMER: I didn't realize it was a full box.

GEORGE: I'm gonna count to three. If you don't give up the chair, the wig

is coming off.

GLENDA: I don't' wear a wig.

GEORGE: One...

ELAINE: No. No. No. No. No. I don't really have a phone. In fact, I - I

really don't have an apartment. I kinda sleep around.

[Levitan & Elaine laughing]

ELAINE: I just like to have and few drinks and just let the guy do whatever

he wants. Would you close your eyes for a second? I wanna tell you a

secret about my bra.

[George empties contents of tiny bottle into Levitan's drink]

[Elaine & Levitan laughing]

GEORGE: Hello, Rick.

LEVITAN: Heh heh heh hey! Look who's here!

GEORGE: That's right, Ricky Boy, it's me!

LEVITAN: You know something, Costanza? I'm a very lucky man.

GEORGE: Oh!

LEVITAN: I've always been lucky. Things just seem to fall right in my lap.

GEORGE: Boom!

[all laughing]

LEVITAN: You wouldn't believe it if I told you. In fact, uh, I'm glad

you're here. You know, maybe I've been a little rough on ya, huh?

GEORGE: Oh.

LEVITAN: Why should we let petty, personal differences get in the way of

business? I, uh, I want

you to come back. You can use my bathroom anytime you want.

GEORGE: You want me to come back? Uh...

LEVITAN: Hey! How about a toast, huh? Everybody, a toast!

GEORGE: Rick.

LEVITAN: Everyone, I wanna propose a toast to ten great years at Rick Barr

Properties.

GEORGE: Uh, Rick..

LEVITAN: And all the people in this room, [clears throat] that made that

possible..

GEORGE: Rick.

LEVITAN: I'd also like to welcome back into the fold our..our little

shrimpy friend, George Costanza who, although he didn't really have a

very good year -- how you blew that McConnell deal, I'll never know. But,

hey, what the hell, huh? We've always enjoyed his antics around the

office. Heh heh. Anything you wanna add to this?

GEORGE: Drink up. I like history. Civil War. Maybe I could be a professor,

or something.

ELAINE: Well, to teach something you really have to know a lot about it. I

think you need a degree.

JERRY: Yeah. That's true. What? My God, the money! The 1500! Where'd you

find it?

KRAMER: It was in my laundry.

JERRY: In your laundry the whole time? I told you not to mix in our guys.

What did we figure the damage on that machine would be?

KRAMER: It was about 1200 bucks.

NEWMAN: Kramer!

KRAMER: Oh! That's Newman.

NEWMAN: I'm on the roof!

KRAMER: Well, what are you waiting for?

JERRY: Elaine, come on, take a walk with me down to the Laundromat. I gotta

pay this guy the money..

GEORGE: I like horses. Maybe I could be a stable boy.

KRAMER: You wanna shoot some pool tonight?

NEWMAN: I can't. I'm goin' to the movies.

GEORGE: Nah. It's probably a union thing.

[Setting: Night club]

JERRY: You know, I tell ya, I gotta say that I'm enjoying adulthood. For a lot of reasons. And, I'll tell you reason number one: as an adult, if I want a cookie, I have

a cookie, okay? I have three cookies or four cookies, or eleven cookies if I want. Many times I will intentionally ruin my entire appetite. Just ruin it. And then, I call

my mother up right after to tell her that I did it. "Hello, Mom? yeah, I just ruined my entire appetite.. cookies." So what if you ruin.. See, because as an adult, we

understand even if you ruin an appetite, there's another appetite coming right behind it. There's no danger in running out of appetites. I've got millions of them, I'll ruin

them whenever I want!

(Scene ends)

[Setting: Jerry's apartment]

(Jerry's sitting on his couch in the dark, watching TV)

TV VOICE: (Germanic) Look, Sigmund. Look in the sky. The planets are on fire. It is just as you prophesied. The planets of our solar system, incinerating. Like

flaming globes, Sigmund. Like flaming globes.. Ah, ha, ha, ha..

(Jerry's now asleep)

(Scene ends)

[Setting: Jerry's bedroom]

(Jerry's laying in his bed. He wakes suddenly, picks up a pen and scribbles something down on a pad. He laughs, shakes his head, then goes back to sleep, laughing

to himself)

(Scene ends)

[Setting: Coffee shop]

(Jerry looks tired. He's staring at a crumpled piece of note paper. George takes out a cucumber from a bag in his pocket)

ELAINE: What do you got, a cucumber?

GEORGE: Yeah, so what?

ELAINE: You're bringing in an outside cucumber?

GEORGE: They refuse to put cucumber in the salad. I need cucumber.

JERRY: (Trying to read the note) What have I done? I can't read this! Ful-hel-mo-nen-ter-val? I got up last night, I wrote this down, I thought I had this great bit.

(Tries to focus on the paper) Wait a second, wait a second.. "Fax me some halibut." Is that funny? Is that a joke?

ELAINE: No. Let me see that. (Takes the paper from Jerry) Don't-mess-with-Johnny."

JERRY: Johnny? Johnny who? Johnny Carson? Did I insult Johnny on The Tonight Show?

ELAINE: (Joking) Did you mess with Johnny, Jerry?

GEORGE: Let me see that. (Studies the note)

ELAINE: Hey, where's Kramer?

JERRY: I don't know. That's like asking "Where's Waldo?"

GEORGE: (Still holding the note) I think I'm having a heart attack.

JERRY: I don't think that's it.

GEORGE: I'm not kidding.

JERRY: What does that mean?

ELAINE: I think what he's trying to say is that he's having a heart attack.

JERRY: Oh, he's having a heart attack.

GEORGE: Tightness..

JERRY: C'mon.

GEORGE: Shortness of breath..

JERRY: Oh, this is ridiculous.

GEORGE: Radiating waves of pain..

JERRY: I know what this is. You saw that show on PBS last night, Coronary Country. (To Elaine) I saw it in the TV Guide. I called him and told him to make sure

and not watch it.

GEORGE: There was nothing else on. Oh, the left arm.. the left arm.

JERRY: (To Elaine) He saw that show on anorexia last year, and ate like an animal for two weeks.

GEORGE: Why can't I have a heart attack? I'm allowed.

JERRY: So what do you want? You want me take you to the hospital?

GEORGE: Manhattan Memorial, less of a line.

JERRY: I'll call an ambulance. (Exits)

(A waitress approaches. George is dying, but the waitress doesn't seem to notice)

WAITRESS: Is everything alright?

GEORGE: We'll just take a check. (She leaves the check. George, in all his cheapness, can't help but to review the check. He finds an error) You made a mistake

on the..

ELAINE: George!

(Scene ends)

[Setting: Hospital room]

(George lies in the bed. He has EKG cups on his chest, a tube up his nose, and an IV in his arm. The man in the neighboring bed seems to be in pain)

MAN: Ooohhh... Argghhh..

GEORGE: Are.. are you okay?

MAN: Ooooooohhh..

GEORGE: I'm George.. George Costanza.. I've never been in the hospital a day in my life.. except when I had my tonsils out. You know, they never gave me any

ice cream. I always felt that-

MAN: Shut up!

(Scene goes to Jerry. He's standing at the doorway, showing the note to a nurse)

JERRY: Well? What do you think?

NURSE 1: "Salami, salami, bologna." Definitely.

JERRY: "Salami salami bologna"?

DOCTOR: (In a hurry) Oh, your friend's fine. He didn't have a heart attack. I'll be in - in a few minutes.

JERRY: (Sarcastic) What a surprise. (Enters George's room overly sympathetic - leading George to think that the Doctor told Jerry something significant) Hey, how

ya doin' buddy? You need anything? Do you want me to go out and get you a Superman comic?

GEORGE: No, no thanks.

JERRY: (Still going along with the practical joke) You know, I was wondering.. You know that Black Hawks jacket you have?

GEORGE: Oh, sure, my Black Hawks jacket. I love my Black Hawks jacket.

JERRY: Well, you know, I was thinking - if things don't exactly work out..

GEORGE: Well, it wouldn't fit you. The sleeves are too short.

JERRY: No, I tried it on. It fits good.

GEORGE: Well, I didn't really think about what I was gonna do with all..

JERRY: Well, you know..

GEORGE: (Reluctantly) Well, okay.

JERRY: Oh, and.. do you think it would be alright if I called Susan Davis?

GEORGE: Susan Davis? (Getting possessive) Hey, wait a second..

JERRY: Well, it's not like we'd be bumping into you.

GEORGE: I don't know.. you and Susan Davis?

JERRY: You know, if your future was a little more certain..

GEORGE: Okay, go ahead. Call her, get married, have babies, have a great life.. What do I care? I'm finished. (Really depressed) It's all over for me. In fact, let's

end it right now. Jerry, kill me, kill me now. I'm begging you. Let's just get it over with. Be a pal.. Just take the pillow and put it over my face.

JERRY: Well, ah.. (Takes his pillow) What? Kind of like this? (Violently smothers George with the pillow. George freaks out. He didn't think Jerry would actually

do it)

GEORGE: What are ya doing?! Whadya, crazy?!

(Elaine enters - she gets a clear shot of Jerry's jokingly trying to kill George)

ELAINE: Jerry!

JERRY: (Acts like he was cought red-handed) Elaine, what are you doing here? (Takes the pillow off George, and puts it back on his bed)

GEORGE: (To Jerry) Jerk off.

(Jerry goes over to Elaine)

JERRY: (Whispering) There's nothing wrong with him. I saw the doctor. He's fine.

(They both go to George's bed. Elaine decides to go along with Jerry's joke)

ELAINE: Hi, George. How ya feeling? Is anybody getting your apartment?

(Jerry and Elaine both sit down, and have their own conversation. They completely ignore George)

GEORGE: I'll tell ya, if I ever get out of here, I'm gonna change my life. I'm gonna do a whole Zen thing. Take up yoga, meditate.. I'll eat right. Calm down, lose my

anger.. (Sees Jerry and Elaine aren't listening. He snaps) Hey, is anybody listening?!

(The doctor enters. Elaine and the doctor exchange an awkward, romantic glance)

DOCTOR: (To Elaine) Uh, hello. (To George) Uh, Mr. Costanza?

GEORGE: (Panicky) Uh, yeah. You know, Doctor, I gotta tell you, I feel a lot better.

DOCTOR: Well, we looked at your EKG's, ran some tests, did a complete work-up.

GEORGE: (Getting in a more panicked state) Oh God, Mommy!

DOCTOR: And you simply haven't had a heart attack.

GEORGE: (Relieved) I haven't? I'm okay? I'm okay? Oh, thank you, thank you, Doctor! I don't know how to thank you.

JERRY: (Sarcastic) Hey, that was really fun, George. Can we go home now?

DOCTOR: No, actually, we'd like to keep him here overnight for observation, just to be safe.

GEORGE: Oh, sure. Sure, anything. Can you believe it? There's nothing wrong with me.

DOCTOR: Well, I wouldn't go that far.

GEORGE: (Starting to panic again) What? Oh my God. What? Is it meningitis? Scoliosis? Lupis?! Is it Lupis?!

DOCTOR: Have you ever had your tonsils taken out?

GEORGE: My tonsils? Yeah, when I was a kid.

DOCTOR: Well, they've grown back. Your adenoids are swollen too.

GEORGE: Really?

ELAINE: (Jokingly hits the doctor) Whose tonsils grow back? (Laughs)

DOCTOR: It happens.

JERRY: Yeah, if you've been exposed to gamma rays.

ELAINE: I still have my tonsils. Everyone in my family has their tonsils. In fact, we were forbidden to socialize with anyone who didn't have their tonsils.

DOCTOR: That's interesting. Because, no one in my family has their tonsils, and we were forbidden to socialize with tonsil people.

JERRY: (Sarcastically) Well, it's like the Capulets and the Montagues.

GEORGE: (Drawing attention back to him) Excuse me!

DOCTOR: Anyway, I strongly recommend they come out.

GEORGE: What? You mean with a knife?

DOCTOR: Yes. With a knife. You know, snip, snip. Anyway, you'd be completely under, you wouldn't feel a thing. And when you wake up, you can have some ice

cream.

GEORGE: (Angry) Yeah, that's what they told me the last time.

DOCTOR: Think about it. (Turns to leave, but runs into Elaine) Excuse me.

ELAINE: (Flustered) Oh, I'm sorry. (Doctor exits) I just.. have to ask that doctor one more question. (Leaves)

JERRY: Women go after doctors like men go after models. They want someone with knowledge of the body.. we just want the body.

(Kramer enters, eating off a tray of hospital food)

KRAMER: Hey.

JERRY: Hey.

KRAMER: Boy, they got a great cafeteria downstairs. Hot food, sandwiches, a salad bar.. It's like a Sizzler's opened up a hospital! (Sits and starts eating) So, how

did you have a heart attack? You're a young man. What were you doing? Are they gonna do a zipper job? Oh, they love to do zipper jobs.

JERRY: (Trying to shut him up) Kramer.

KRAMER: The really bad thing about the heart is the sex thing. See, you gotta be careful about sex now. You get that heart pumping and suddenly, boom! Next

thing you know, you got a hose coming out of your chest attached to a piece of luggage.

JERRY: Kramer, George didn't have a heart attack.

KRAMER: No? That's good.

GEORGE: I have to have my tonsils taken out.

KRAMER: Oh man.. No.. George, we gotta get you outta here. Get out! Right now! They'll kill ya in here.

JERRY: (Trying to calm George down) It's routine surgery.

KRAMER: Oh yeah? My friend, Bob Saccomanno, he came in here for a hernia operation.. Oh yeah, routine surgery.. now he's sittin' around in a chair by a

window going, "My name is Bob" .. George, whatever you do, don't let 'em cut you. Don't let 'em cut you..

GEORGE: Well, what should I do, Kramer?

JERRY: Well, for one think, don't listen to him.

KRAMER: I'll tell you what to do, I'll tell you what to do. You go to Tor Eckman. Tor, Tor, he'll fix you right up. He's a herbalist, a healer, George. He's not just

gonna fix the tonsils and the adenoids, he is gonna change the whole way you function - body and mind.

JERRY: Eckman? I thought he was doing time?

KRAMER: No, no, he's out. He got out. See, the medical establishment, see, they tried to frame him. It's all politics. But he's a rebel.

JERRY: A rebel? No. Johnny Yuma was a rebel. Eckman is a nut. George, you want to take care of your tonsils, you do it in a hospital. With a doctor.

KRAMER: He's holistic, George. He's holistic.

GEORGE: Holistic.. that sounds right.

JERRY: George, you need a medical doctor.

GEORGE: (To Jerry) Let me ask you something.. How much do you think it would cost to have tonsils and adenoids removed in the hospital?

JERRY: Well, an overnight stay in a hospital? Minor surgery? I dunno, four grand.

GEORGE: Uh-huh. And how much does the healer charge?

KRAMER: First visit? Thirty-eight bucks.

GEORGE: Oh, yeah? Holistic.. that's what I need. That's the answer.

(Scene ends)

[Setting: Healer's apartment]

(Jerry and George are sitting on huge pillows on the apartment floor. Kramers fiddling with an acupuncture model)

GEORGE: So, how do you like the way I talked you into comin' down here?

JERRY: Don't flatter yourself, my friend. I'm here strictly for material, and I have a feeling this is a potential gold mine.. I still think you're nuts, though.

GEORGE: All I know is I've been going to doctors all my life. What has it gotten me? I'm thirty-three years old. I haven't outgrown the problems of puberty, I'm

already facing the problems of old age. I completely skipped healthy adulthood. I went from having orgasms immediately to taking forever. You could do your taxes

in the time it takes me to have an orgasm. I've never had a normal, medium orgasm.

JERRY: (Jokingly making fun of George) I've never had a really good pickle.

GEORGE: Besides, what's it gonna cost me? Thirty-eight bucks?

(Tor enters. He hugs Kramer for a long time, then walks over to Jerry and George)

TOR: (To Jerry) Would you not put your foot on that please?

JERRY: Sorry.

(Tor sits down, and turns tward George)

TOR: What month were you born?

GEORGE: April.

TOR: You should have been born in August. Your parents would have been well-advised to wait.

GEORGE: Really?

TOR: Do you use hot water in the shower?

GEORGE: Yes.

TOR: Stop using it.

GEORGE: ..Okay.

KRAMER: I'm off hot water.

TOR: Kramer tells me that you are interested in an alternative to surgery.

GEORGE: Yes, yes I am.

TOR: (Blows into George's face) I think we can help you. See, unfortunately, the medical establishment is a business like any other business. And business needs

customers. And, they want to sell you their most expensive item which is unnecessary surgery.

GEORGE: (Still on the showers) Can I use hot water on my face?

TOR: No. You know, I am not a business man. I'm a holistic healer. It's a calling, it's a gift. You see, it's in the best interest of the medical profession that you remain

sick. You see, that insures good business. You're not a patient. You're a customer.

JERRY: (He thinks this, the audience can hear his thoughts) And you're not a doctor, but you play one in real life.

GEORGE: (Still on the hot water) What about shaving?

TOR: (To Jerry) You're eating too much dairy. (To George) May I? (Reaches over, and touches George's face)

GEORGE: I guess so.

TOR: (Feeling George's face) You see, you are in disharmony. The throat is the gateway to the lung. Tonsillitis, adenoiditis, is, in Chinese medical terms, and invasion

of heat and wind.

JERRY: (Again, we hear his thoughts) There's some hot air blowing in here..

TOR: You know, I lived with the Eskimos many years ago, and they used to plunge their faces into the snow.

GEORGE: (Once again, still on the shower) Could it be lukewarm?

JERRY: Too much dairy? You really think I'm eating too much dairy?

(Scene ends)

[Setting: Doctor's car]

(The Doctor and Elaine are almost done with their date. the doctor is speaking seductively to Elaine while holding out her tongue)

DOCTOR: ..The tongue.. yes, the tongue.. or, in medical terms, the glossa. It's a muscular organ.. Consists of two parts.. the body, and the root.. You see, it's

covered by this mucous membrane.. These little raised projections are the papillae, which give it that furry appearance. Very tactile..

(The Doctor is still holding her tongue)

ELAINE: Uh-huh.

(Scene ends)

[Setting: Healer's apartment]

TOR: (Pouring tea) Your tea is ready now. This will solve your so-called tonsil problem. It's a special concoction. It contains crampbark.

JERRY: I love crampbark.

TOR: Cleavers.

JERRY: Cleaver, I once had cleaver as a kid. I was able to lift a car.

TOR: And some couchgrass.

JERRY: Couchgrass and crampbark? You know, I think that's what killed Curly.

(Tor hands George the tea. George isn't willing to drink it right away. Jerry looks skeptical, Kramer, on the other hand, is enthusiastic)

KRAMER: Go ahead, drink it, George.

JERRY: Excuse me, Tor. May I ask you a question? You have intuitive abilities. You're in touch with a lot of this cosmic kind of things.. I have this note I can't read.

I was wondering if-

TOR: (Takes the note, then laughs when he reads it) Oh, yes.. yes.. "Cleveland 117, San Antonio 109.. (Hands note back to Jerry)

KRAMER: Go ahead, drink it, George.

GEORGE: (Takes a sip) Hey, it's not too bad..

(Scene ends)

[Setting: Ambulance]

(George's strapped down on a gurney. His face is purple, and he's screaming. Jerry and Kramer are trying to calm him down. The driver and the assistant in the

back are having a huge fight)

GEORGE: (In a state of hysteria) I'm an eggplant! I'm an eggplant! I'm a minstrel man!

DRIVER: (To Assistant) I didn't take your Chuckle, man!

ASSISTANT: I had five Chuckles. I ate a green one, and the yellow one, and the red one is missing!

DRIVER: I don't even like Chuckles!

JERRY: (To Assistant) Maybe he doesn't like them. That's possible.

GEORGE: My face! My face! Get me to the hospital!

ASSISTANT: I want that Chuckle! You hear me?!

JERRY: (To Assistant) I'll get you a Chuckle. You want me to get you a Chuckle?

ASSISTANT: (Angry, to Driver) Pull over!

DRIVER: Pull over? Did you say pull over?! You want a piece of me?!

ASSISTANT: Yeah!

JERRY: You're gonna fight?

GEORGE: Now?! I'm a mutant!

KRAMER: (To Driver) Hey, let me drive.

ASSISTANT: Come on, man. Pull over!

DRIVER: Alright! I'm gonna mess you up, man!

(Ambulance comes to a screeching halt. Driver gets out, and the assistant heads for the back door)

JERRY: (Pleading) Really, gentlemen, please.

GEORGE: My heart! My heart! (To Assistant) Where you going? Are you crazy?!

ASSISTANT: I'm gonna kick his ass.

KRAMER: (To Assistant) Hey, you have keys?

GEORGE: You can't leave! This is an ambulance! This is an emergency!

(The Assistant leaves. Jerry, Kramer, and George watch the two fight)

JERRY: All this for a Chuckle.

KRAMER: What's a Chuckle?

JERRY: It's a jelly candy. it comes in five flavors.

(Scene ends)

[Setting: Doctor's car]

(He's still holding Elaine's tongue)

DOCTOR: You see, taste buds run on grooves along the surfaces.

ELAINE: Can you let go of my tongue now?

DOCTOR: What?

ELAINE: Let go of my tongue!

DOCTOR: (Lets go) Oh, sorry.

ELAINE: Well, I should get going.. (The Doctor leans in for a kiss. Elaine stops him) What are you doing?

DOCTOR: I was going to kiss you good night.

ELAINE: A kiss? With the tongue? The glossa with the bumps and the papillae? ..Yech, I don't think so. (Leaves)

(Scene ends)

[Setting: Ambulance]

(It's now moving. The driver's behind the wheel, but the assistant is nowhere in sight)

JERRY: You just can't leave him out there.

DRIVER: I told him I was gonna mess him up.

KRAMER: Well, can you call him an ambulance?

DRIVER: I told him I didn't take his Chuckle. I don't eat that gooey crap!

KRAMER: hey, watch the road! Watch the road, man!

DRIVER: (Turns back, facing Kramer) Hey, man, you want some of what he got?!

JERRY AND KRAMER: Watch out!

(The Ambulance crashes into something)

(Scene ends)

[Setting: Hospital room]

(George is in the bed, watching TV, wearing a neck brace. Jerry enters limping and wearing a neck brace, also. He talks to George, but George can't respond

verbally)

JERRY: How ya doing? (George nods) Can't talk? (George shakes his head. Jerry gestures to his brace) Hey, how'd you get the plastic one? (George raises his

eyebrows) I like that. (George sticks his tongue out) So how's life without tonsils? (George quickly indicates with his arm that he wants ice cream) What? What's

that? ..So, how much is this thing gonna cost you now? Like, five, six thousand?.. (George signals that it's more) Well, live and learn.. at least we lived. Kramer went

to Eckman.. He feels better alreadyy.. (George motions for ice cream again) What are you doing?

(Elaine enters)

ELAINE: Oh, poor George. Oh, I'm sorry, but I can't stay long. I don't want to run into Doctor Tongue.. Here, I brought you something. (Takes out a pint of ice

cream. George gets excited) Oh, please, come on.. it was nothing.

(Nurse enters)

JERRY: Hey, check the TV.

(The TV is showing the same exact movie Jerry was watching at the start of the show)

TV VOICE: (Germanic) It's just as you prophesied. The planets of our solar system, incinerating. Like flaming globes, Sigmond. Like flaming globes. Ah, ha, ha, ha..

JERRY: (Pulls the note out of his pocket) That's it! That's it! Flaming globes of Sigmond! Flaming Globes of Sigmond! That's my note! tha'ts what I thought was so

funny?! ..That's not funny.. There's nothing funny about that.

MAN IN NEIGHBORING BED: Shut up!

(George throws the whole carton of ice cream over the separating curtan)

MAN: Aaahhhgggg!

(Scene ends)

[Setting: Night club]

JERRY: I have a friend who's a hypochondriac, always thinks he's sick - never is. And they, you have another type of person, always thinks they're well, not matter

how bad they really are. You know this type of person? Very annoying. "Feel great.. like being on the respirator.. intravenous heart/lung machine. I never felt better

in my life." Medical science is making advances every day in control health problems. In fact, it's probably only a matter of time before a heart attack, you know,

becomes like, a head ache. We'll just see people on TV going, "I had a heart attack this big (Holds out hands, gesturing bigness) ..but, I gave myself one of these.

Clear! (Puts imaginary electrode panels to his chest) Brrhht.. and it's gone!"

END OF SHOW.


Opening Monologue: I've been watching women in the department stores. They're trying on clothes, and I've noticed that they do it differently from men. Women don't try on the clothes, they get behind the clothes, you see? They take a dress off the rack, and they hold it up against themself. They can tell something from this. They stick one leg way out 'cause they nedd to know, if some day I'm one-legged, and at a fourty-five degree angle, what am I gonna wear? You never see a man do that. You never see a guy take a suit off the rack, put his head in the neck, and go, "What do you think about this suit? I think I'll get it. Yeah, it looks fine. Put some shoes by the bottom of the pants, I wanna make sure. Yeah, perfect. And what if I'm walking? Move the shoes, move the shoes, move the shoes, move the shoes.


% While Jerry and Elaine are sitting on Jerry's couch watching the tube, Elaine is flipping through the channels constantly.


Jerry: What are you doing? All right, all right. What's the matter with that? What about that one?


Elaine: Robert Vaughn, The Helsinki Formula?


Jerry: He was good in Man From Uncle.


Elaine: Guess whose birthday's comin' up soon?


Jerry: I know, I'm having my root canal the same week.


Elaine: Oh, right. I hope you have a good oral surgeon because that can be very serious. (Changes channel) Hey, look at naked people.


Jerry: No, I don't wanna see the naked people.


Elaine: Been a while?


Jerry: I have a vague recollection of doing something with someone, but it was a long, long time ago.


Elaine: I think my last time was in Rochester. My hair was a lot shorter.


Jerry: I remember that it's a good thing. Someday, I hope to do it again. (Jerry looks at Elaine)


Elaine: What?


Jerry: What?


Elaine: What was that look?


Jerry: What look?


Elaine: The look you just gave me.


Jerry: I gave a look?


Elaine: Yes.


Jerry: What kind of look?


Elaine: I know that look.


Jerry: Then what was it?


Elaine: Why should I tell you?


Jerry: Well, you're the big look expert. I wanna see how smart you are.


Elaine: Trust me. I know the look. (Pause) So...


Jerry: What?


Elaine: What about the look?


Jerry: I don't know.


Elaine: You got something on your mind?


Jerry: No. Things pop into your head. You?


Elaine: Things occur to me from time to time.


Jerry: Yeah, me too. Well, you can't expect to just forget the past completely.


Elaine: No, of course not.


Jerry: I mean, it was something we did. Probably about, what? Twenty-five times?


Elaine: Thirty-seven.


Jerry: Yeah, we pretty much know what we're doin' in there. (Points to bedroom)


Elaine: We know the terrain.


Jerry: No big surprises.


Elaine: Nope.


Jerry: What do you think?


Elaine: I don't know. What do you think?


Jerry: Well, it's something to consider.


Elaine: Yeah.


Jerry: I mean, let's say we did.


Elaine: What if.


Jerry: Is that like the end of the world or something?


Elaine: Certainly not.


Jerry: Why shouldn't we be able to do that once in a while if we want to?


Elaine: I know.


Jerry: I mean, really, what is the big deal? We go in there. (Points to the bedroom) We're in there for a while. We come right back out here. It's not complicated.


Elaine: It's almost stupid if we didn't.


Jerry: It's moronic.


Elaine: Absurd!


Jerry: Of course, I guess, maybe, some little problems could arise.


Elaine: We, there are always a few.


Jerry: I mean, if anything happened, and we couldn't be friends the way we are now, that would be really bad.


Elaine: Devastating.


Jerry: Because this is very good. (Points back and forth between them to indicate friendship)


Elaine: And that would be good. (Points to bedroom)


Jerry: That would be good too. The idea is combine the this and the that. But this cannot be disturbed.


Elaine: Yeah, we just wanna take this and add that.


Jerry: But of course, we'd have to figure out a way to avoid the things that cause the little problems. Maybe some rules or something.


Elaine: Huh.


Jerry: For example, now, I call you whenever I'm inclined and vice versa.


Elaine: Right.


Jerry: But if we did that, we might feel a certain obligation to call.


Elaine: Well why should that be? Oh, I have an idea. I have an idea. No call the day after that.


Jerry: Beautiful. Let's make it a rule.


Elaine: All right, sir.


Jerry: Now here's another little rule. When we see each other now, we retire to our separate quarters. But sometimes, when people get involved with that, they feel pressure to sleep over. When that is not really sleep. Sleep is separate from that. And I don't see why sleep got all tied up and connected with that.


Elaine: Okay, okay. Spending the night is optional!


Jerry: Well now we're gettin' somewhere.


Elaine: What about the kiss goodnight?


Jerry: Tough one. You're call.


Elaine: It's brug-wa (?).


Jerry: Fine. Well.


Elaine: Well.


Jerry: You ready?


Elaine: Ready.


Jerry: So think you can handle this?


Elaine: Definitely. (Runs into bookshelf)


% Jerry's apartment the next day. Kramer enters.


Kramer: Hey.


Jerry: Hey.


Kramer: Got the paper?


Jerry: Not yet.


Kramer: No paper?


Jerry: I haven't been out yet.


Kramer: Well, what's taking you so long? (Elaine enters from the bedroom. Kramer is a little shocked) Uh? Oh, well, yeah... (He exits)


% George and Jerry at Monk's.


George: What's the deal with Aquaman? Could he go on land, or was he just restricted to water?


Jerry: No, I think I saw him on land a couple times. So how's the job situation goin'?


George: Still lookin'. It's pretty bad out there. What about you?


Jerry: Nothin' much. I slept with Elaine last night.


George: Oxygen! I need some oxygen! This is major.


Jerry: I thought you'd like that.


George: Oh, this is huge!


Jerry: I know.


George: All right, okay. Let's go, details.


Jerry: No, I can't do details.


George: You wha?


Jerry: I can't give details.


George: No details?


Jerry: I'm not in the mood.


George: You ask me to have lunch, tell me you slept with Elaine, and then say you're not in the mood for details. Now you listen to me. I want details and I want them right now. I don't have a job, I have no place to go. You're not in the mood? Well you get in the mood!


Jerry: All right, okay. We're in the apartment watching TV.


George: Where are you sitting?


Jerry: On the couch.


George: Next to each other?


Jerry: No, separated.


George: Time?


Jerry: About eleven.


George: Okay, go ahead.


Jerry: So she's flipping around the TV, and she gets to the naked station.


George: Oh, see? that's why I don't have cable in my house. Because of that naked station. If I had that in my house, I would never turn it off. I wouldn't sleep, I wouldn't eat. Eventually, firemen would have to break through the door, they'd find me sitting there in my pajamas with drool coming down my face. All right, all right. So you're watching the naked station.


Jerry: And then, somehow, we started talking about, what if we had sex.


George: Boy, these are really bad details.


Jerry: It pains me to say this, but I may be getting to mature for details.


George: Oh I hate to hear this. That kind of growth really irritates me.


Jerry: Well. I'll tell you though. It was really passionate.


George: Better than before?


Jerry: She must've taken some kind of seminar or something.


George: This is all too much. So what are you feeling? What's going on? Are you like a couple again now?


Jerry: Not exactly.


George: Not exactly. What does that mean?


Jerry: Well, we've tried to arrange a situation where we'll be able to do this once in a while and still be friends. (George laughs hysterically and stands oiut of his seat)


George: Where are you living? Are you here? Are you on this planet? It's impossible. It can't be done.
(He sits back down) Thousands of years people have been trying to have their cake and eat it too. So all of a sudden the two of you are going to come along and do it. Where do you get the ego? No one can do it. It can't be done.


Jerry: I think we've worked out a system.


George: Oh, you know what you're like? You're like a pathetic gambler. You're one of those losers in Las Vegas who keeps thinking he's gonna come up with a way to win at blackjack.


Jerry: No, this is very advanced. We've designed at set of rules that we can maintain the friendship by advancing all of the relationship pitfalls.


George: Sure, all right. Tell me the rules.


Jerry: Okay. No calls the next day.


George: (To himself) So you're havin' the sex, next day you don't have to call. That's pretty good. (Back to Jerry) Go ahead.


Jerry: You ready for the second one?


George: I have tell you, I'm pretty impressed with the first one.


Jerry: Spending the night. Optional.


George: No, you see? You got greedy.


Jerry: No, that's the rule. It's optional.


George: I know less about women than anyone in the world. But one thing I do know is they're not happy if you don't spend the night. I could be a hot, sweaty room with no air conditioning and all they have is a little army cot this wide (Displays with French fry) You're not going anywhere.


Jerry: I think you're wrong.


George: I hope I am.


% At Elaine's apartment, Jerry opens the fridge and pulls out a piece of cake.


Jerry: Is this yours or the roommate's?


Elaine: The roommate's.


Jerry: Would she mind?


Elaine: She keeps track of everything.


Jerry: Well, that's too bad, 'cause I'm takin' it.


Elaine: Thanks.


Jerry: Well, guess I'll get going.


Elaine: Oh.


Jerry: Well, I have that root canal tomorrow morning. It'll be easier if I go home.


Elaine: Fine, go away.


Jerry: I don't understand. Is there a problem? (Elaine is pulling a roll of paper towels about twenty feet long) I'm getting the impression there's a problem.


Elaine: Just go.


Jerry: I'm having surgery tomorrow.


Elaine: Oh, surgery. You're going to the dentist.


Jerry: But you said, it can be very serious.


Elaine: Okay, so fine. Go.


Jerry: What happened to the rules? Remember? Sleeping over was optional.


Elaine: Yeah, it's my house, it's my option.


Jerry: It has nothing to do with whose house it is.


Elaine: Oh, of course it does. (Elaine's roommate, Tina, enters)


Tina: Hi.


Elaine + Jerry: Hi.


Tina: Hi, Jerry.


Jerry: Hi.


Tina: Such a great improv class tonight.


Elaine: Oh really?


Tina: I had this improv where I pretended I was working in one of those booths. You know, in the amusement park, where you have to shoot the water in the clown's mouth and you have to blow up the balloon.


Elaine: Uh, Tina? Could you excuse us for just one second?


Tina: Oh, yeah. I'll excuse you. (She walks away)


Elaine: What are you doing?


Jerry: I can't go if you're mad.


Elaine: I'm not mad.


Jerry: You seemed a little mad.


Elaine: No, no. Jerry, I'm fine really. It's okay.


Jerry: So you're okay with everything?


Elaine: Definitely. Are you?


Jerry: Definitely. Well, goodnight.


Elaine: Goodn-- (He starts to kiss her) What're you doing?


Jerry: What?


Elaine: Rules.


Tina: Hey, who took my cake? (Jerry exits quickly)


% Jerry and George are at the store.


George: What about jewelry? That's very nice gift.


Jerry: No, no. I have to be very careful here. I don't want to send the wrong message. Especially after the other night.


George: Maybe I'll get her some jewelry.


Jerry: No, no. You can't get her anything better than me. Whatever I spend, you have to spend half.


George: What am I supposed to get, a bazooka?


Jerry: You don't understand. I'm in a very delicate position. Whatever I give her, she's going to be bringing in experts from all over the country to interpret the meaning behind it.


George: What does she need? Maybe there's something that she needs.


Jerry: I think I heard her say something about a bench.


George: A bench? What kind of a bench?


Jerry: I don't know, but she mentioned a bench.


George: What, like at a bus stop?


Jerry: I don't know.


George: Like a park bench?


Jerry: I have no idea.


George: Who puts a bench in their house?


Jerry: Forget the bench.


George: I got it. You wanna get her something nice? How 'bout a music box?


Jerry: No, too relationshippy. She opens it up, she hears that Laura's theme, I'm dead.


George: Okay, what about a nice frame? With a picture of another guy in it. Frame says I care for you, but if you wanna get serious, perhaps you'd be interested in someone like this.


Jerry: Nice looking fellow.


George: What about candle holders?


Jerry: Too romantic.


George: Lingerie?


Jerry: Too sexual.


George: Waffle maker.


Jerry: Too domestic.


George: Bust of Nelson Rockefeller.


Jerry: Too Gubernatorial. (?)


George: Let's work on the card.


% Jerry and Elaine sitting on his couch. Elaine holding a present.


Jerry: Maybe you won't like it.


Elaine: Oh, how could I not like it? Of course I'll like it.


Jerry: You could not like it.


Elaine: Just the fact that you remembered means everything.


Jerry: Of course I remembered. You reminded me everyday for two months. Oh, the card. (She opens)


Elaine: Cash?


Jerry: Would do you think?


Elaine: You got me cash?


Jerry: Well this way I figure you can go out and get yourself whatever you want. No good?


Elaine: Who are you, my uncle?


Jerry: Well come on. That's $182 right there. I don't think that's anything to sneeze at.


Elaine: Let me see the card. (Reading) To a wonderful girl, a great pal, and more? (Kramer enters)


Kramer: Hey. Oh, Elaine. I'm glad you're here. Stay right there. I'm gonna be right back. (He exits)


Elaine: Pal? You think I'm your pal?


Jerry: I said, "and more."


Elaine: I am not your pal.


Jerry: What's wrong with pal? Why is everyone so down on pal? (Kramer enters with present)


Elaine: Oh, what is this? You got me something?


Kramer: Yeah. Open it.


Elaine: Oh Kramer... (She opens it) The bench! You got me the bench that I wanted! (Jerry looks irritated)


Kramer: That's pretty good, huh?


Jerry: Great.


Kramer: Remember when we were standing there and she mentioned it? I made a mental note of it.


Jerry: Well goody for you.


Kramer: Oh yeah, I'm very sensitive about that. I mean, when someone's birthday comes up, I keep my ears open. So what'd you get her?


Jerry: 182 bucks.


Kramer: Cash? You gotta be kidding. What kind of gift is that? That's like something her uncle would get her.


Elaine: (Reading card) Think where man's glory most begins and ends and say my glory was I had such a friend.


Kramer: (To Jerry) Yeats.


Elaine: Oh Kramer. (They embrace)


Jerry: Could you excuse us please?


Kramer: What?


Jerry: We're talking.


Kramer: Oh, the relationship. (He leaves)


Jerry: You know, we never had one fight before this deal.


Elaine: I know.


Jerry: Never.


Elaine: Ever.


Jerry: We got along beautifully.


Elaine: Like clams.


Jerry: It was wonderful.


Elaine: A pleasure.


Jerry: So I think we should just forget the whole deal, and go back to being friends.


Elaine: I can't do it.


Jerry: You what?


Elaine: I can't do that.


Jerry: You mean it's... (She nods) No this. No that. No this or that. Oh, boy. What do you want?


Elaine: This, that, and the other.


Jerry: Oh, sure. Of course, you're entitled. Who doesn't want this, that, and the other?


Elaine: You.


Jerry: (Starts to correct then realizes) Well...


% Jerry and George at Monk's.


George: Those birthdays. I told you. They're relationship killers. If a relationship is having any problems whatsoever, a birthday will always bring it out.


Jerry: I never should have made up those rules.


George: What is it about sex that just disrupts everything? Is it the touching? Is it the nudity?


Jerry: It can't be the nudity. I never got into these terrible fights and misunderstandings when I was changing before gym class.


George: You know what this means? I can't see her anymore either.


Jerry: Why?


George: It's break up by association. Besides, she's mad at me anyway because of my birthday present.


Jerry: What did you end up giving her?


George: 91 dollars.


Jerry: Sorry about that.


George: So what're you gonna do?


Jerry: Well, if I call her, there's no joking around anymore. This is pretty much it.


George: So, maybe this should be it.


Jerry: Could be it.


George: She seems like an it.


Jerry: She's at it as you get. Imagine bumping into her on the street in five years with a husband. And she tells me he's a sculptor, they live in Vermont...


George: We'd have to kill him.


Jerry: We'd get caught, I'd get the chair.


George: I'd go to prison as your accomplice. I'd have to wear that really heavy denim. Go to the cafeteria line with the guy who slops those mashed potatoes onto your plate. Go to the bathroom in front of hundreds of people.


Jerry: Plus, you know what else.


George: You better call her.


% Jerry's apartment, Kramer enters.


Kramer: Hey.


Jerry: Hey.


Kramer: You got the paper yet?


Jerry: Yeah.


Kramer: Well where is it? (Elaine enters from bedroom with newspaper) Hey, you done with that?


Elaine: No.


Kramer: Well, you're not reading it now.


Elaine: All right, you can take it. But I want it back.


Kramer: Oh yeah. So, ah, what're you guys gonna do today?


Elaine: Ah, this. And that.


Jerry: And the other.


Kramer: Boy, I really liked the two of you much better when you weren't a couple. (He exits)


End.


[Setting: Night club]

JERRY: Men flip around the television more than women, I think. Men get that remote control in their hands, they don't even know what the hell they're watching.

You know, we just keep going, "Rerun, don't wanna watch it.. " "What are you watching?" "I don't care, I gotta keep going." "Who was that?" "I don't know what it

was - doesn't matter, it's not your fault. It doesn't matter, I gotta keep going." Women don't do this. See now, women will stop and go, "Well, let me see what the

show is before I change the channel." You see? Men just fly. Because women, you see, women nest and men hunt. That's why we watch TV differently. Before

there was flipping around, before there was television, kings and emperors and pharaohs and such had story-tellers that would tell them stories 'cause that was their

entertainment. I always wonder, in that era, if they would get, like, thirty story-tellers together so they could still flip around. Just go, "Alright start telling me a story,

what's happening? I don't want to hear anymore. Shut up. Go to the next guy. What are you talking about? Is there a girl in that story? ..No? Shut up. Go to the next

guy. What do you got? I don't want to hear that either. Shut up. No, go ahead, what are you talking about?.. I don't want to hear that. No, the all of you, get out of

here. I'm going to bed."

(Scene ends)

[Setting: Coffee shop]

GEORGE: (Shocked) She's pregnant? Leslie is pregnant?! Oh, see, there is no justice.

JERRY: She's the performance artist, right?

GEORGE: (Sarcastic) Yeah, performance artist. She's a real performer. A real trooper.

JERRY: What's her husband's name, again? Chip? Kip? Skip?

ELAINE: Todd.

JERRY: Todd. Oh yeah. (To George) He's a Kennedy.

ELAINE: No, he's not.

JERRY: C'mon. He's a third cousin, or something.

ELAINE: By marriage.

JERRY: Oh, by marriage. (To George) We went to their wedding. You should have heard him talking about Chappaquiddick - trying to blame the whole thing on

bad directions.

GEORGE: That woman was unequivocally the worst date of my life.

ELAINE: Oh, pardon me for trying to set you up with a beautiful, intelligent woman.

GEORGE: What, you don't think I can attract beautiful, intelligent women?

JERRY: Thin ice, George. Thin ice..

GEORGE: (Sarcastic) Maybe for her new performance piece she'll give birth on stage.

ELAINE: She stopped performing.

GEORGE: (Again, sarcastic) Oh, what a huge blow to the culture.

JERRY: (Gesturing to George) You believe this guy? He holds a grudge like Khomeini.

GEORGE: She dragged me down to that warehouse on the waterfront in Brooklin to see one of her "performances".

JERRY: Oh, and she cooks dinner onstage for some celebrity?

GEORGE: God! She's cooking dinner for God! She's yelling and screaming, and the next thing I know, she throws a big can of chocolate syrup all over my new red

shirt.

ELAINE: It was an accident!

GEORGE: Oh, yeah, sure, accident, right. She was aiming right at me like she was putting out a fire! Then, for the rest of the show, I'm sitting there with chocolate all

over my shirt. Flies are landing on me. I'm boiling - I'm fantasizing all the things I'm gonna say when I see her. And later, finally, backstage when I talk to her, I'm a

groveling worm. "What kind of chocolate was that? Do you throw any other foods?"

JERRY: (To Elaine) he thought he still had a shot.

GEORGE: And then, then, then she leaves with somebody else! Never even, never even said goodbye! Never called me back.. Never apologized. Nothing. Like I

was dirt.

JERRY: What ever happened with the shirt?

GEORGE: I still have it. The collar's okay. I wear it under sweaters.

ELAINE: I don't know what I'm gonna do. She asked me to give her a baby shower.

JERRY: Asked you? You're not going to do that are you?

ELAINE: anyone else, never. But, Leslie - I have a problem saying no to. For some reason, I seem to want her approval.

GEORGE: Let Maria Shriver give her a baby shower.

JERRY: Ask not what I can do for you - ask what you can do for me.

GEORGE: (Germanic) Ich bin ein sucker.

ELAINE: Oh, would you two stop with the Kennedys? Why does everybody make such a big deal about he Kennedys? What is this fascination?! Who cares?! It's

all so boring..

GEORGE: She doesn't deserve a baby shower. She deserves a baby monsoon. She deserves Rosemary's baby!

ELAINE: (To Jerry) I do have one teeny little problem, though.

GEORGE: Never said goodbye. Never apologized. Nothing.

ELAINE: See, I was gonna give the shower in my apartment..

JERRY: But?

ELAINE: My roommate has Lyme disease.

JERRY: Lyme disease? I thought she had Epstein-Barr Syndrome?

ELAINE: She has this in addition to Epstein-Barr. It's like Epstein-Barr with a twist of Lyme disease.

JERRY: How did she get Lyme disease?

ELAINE: I don't know. She did some outdoor version of Hair in Danbury, Connecticut.

JERRY: They still do that play?

ELAINE: It's a classic.

JERRY: With all the nudity?

ELAINE: I guess. She must've rolled over on a tick during the love-in.

GEORGE: (Still mad a Leslie) Never said goodbye. Goodbye!

JERRY: Explain to me how this baby shower thing works.

ELAINE: What do you wanna know?

JERRY: Well, I mean, does it ever erupt into a drunken orgy of violence?

ELAINE: Rarely.

JERRY: There's no hazing of the fetus, or anything, is there?

ELAINE: No.

JERRY: When is this suppose to be?

ELAINE: Saturday.

JERRY: Saturday?.. Well, I have a show in Buffalo on Saturday. They're not gonna bust up my apartment, or anything, are they?

ELAINE: I'll take full responsibility. You won't regret it.

JERRY: 'Cause I've seen these pregnant women - and they sometimes misjudge their fetal girth. Just like one wrong turn, and boom! And entire buffet is swept off

the table.

GEORGE: Someday, before I die, mark my words - I'm gonna tell that woman exactly what I think of her. I'll never be able to forgive myself until I do.

JERRY: And if you do?

GEORGE: I still won't be able to forgive myself - but at least it won't be about this.

(Scene ends)

[Setting: Jerry's apartment]

(Jerry's TV's not giving a clear picture. He messes with the dials as Kramer looks over his shoulder)

KRAMER: What are you doing this for? Look at you..

JERRY: Quiet. I'm trying to get a picture.

KRAMER: But you don't have to do this! This guy is waiting in my house.

JERRY: (Pleading) Leave me alone.

KRAMER: It's a one-time fee. A hundred and fifty bucks. Why live like this?!

JERRY: I'm not getting illegal cable!

KRAMER: Oh, so what are you gonna do? You gonna wait for the cable companies to resolve their dispute? They're gonna be in court for years.

JERRY: No, I read in the paper..

KRAMER: (Sarcastic) Oh, oh, the paper..

JERRY: Well, they might hook us up again.

KRAMER: Oh, God, you're so naive! All the cable companies care about is the "Big Mammoo." (Jerry wacks the TV) Oh, look at you! You're banging things..

Pathetic. Just wasting your life. I'm offering you fifty-six channels - movies, sports, nudity. And it's free! For life!

JERRY: Stop shouting! You're ruining the reception.

KRAMER: Can you hear yourself? Can, can, do you know what you're saying?!

JERRY: What you're suggesting is illegal.

KRAMER: It's not illegal.

JERRY: It's against the law.

KRAMER: Well, yeah.

JERRY: (Gesturing to the rabbit ears) Just, just, hold this. Can you hold that?

KRAMER: (Holding the rabbit ears) Look, will you at least let me bring the guy over? He's an amazing man. He's a Russian immigrant. He escaped the Gulag. He's

like the Sakharov of cable guys.. He'll slow down your gas meter. He sells slugs, Jerry. Slugs for the subway.

JERRY: A real human rights nut, huh?

KRAMER: Yeah. He's intense, man.

JERRY: I don't know. What if I get caught?

KRAMER: Oh, you're not gonna get caught. Look, let me get him. Man, it's the nineties, it's Hammer time! Come on, just let me get him.

(Kramer drops the rabbit ears, and goes to his apartment. He then returns with a Russian cable guy - Anatoly Tabachnick, and his assistant. Tabachnick mumbles,

shakes, laughs, then wanders around the apartment. Jerry looks confused)

JERRY: You know, why don't we wait? Because, I'm going out of town tomarrow.

TABACHNICK: Tomarrow okay.

KRAMER: No problem. Yeah, you'll have the whole thing installed by the time you get back.

JERRY: (Mutters to himself) Every time I turn on the TV, sirens are gonna go off. They're gonna track me down like a dog, I know it..

KRAMER: No, no, now look now, Jerry, Jerry, it's no risk. I swear. The Mets have seventy-five games on cable this year..

JERRY: (Pauses, thinking about what Kramer just said) Put it in.

KRAMER: You won't regret it. (Jerry mutters some more, Kramer rubs his hands together in anticipation, then starts dancing around with a reluctant Jerry) Jerry's

gonna be a cable boy, a cable boy, a cable boy..

(Scene ends)

[Setting: Jerry's apartment]

(Jerry enters carrying luggage. A group of nem in suits are waiting for him)

MAN: Mr. Steinfeld?

JERRY: Seinfeld.

MAN: We're with the FBI. You wanna tell us about your cable hook-up?

JERRY: My cable hook-up? What about it?

MAN: It's been illegally installed, Mr. Steinfeld.

JERRY: It has? I've been out of town. How did you know?

(An agent leads Kramer out of the bedroom into the living room)

KRAMER: Jerry, I had to tell them. I had to. I had no choice. They were onto the scam from the very beginning.

MAN: You're in serious trouble, Mr. Steinfeld.

JERRY: Wait a minute. Wait a minute, hold on! We're just patsies. We're just a couple of users.. We never sold the stuff. What about the Russian guy? The Russian

guy is the guy you want.

(Tabachnick steps out of the bedroom. He's dressed like the other FBI men, and speaks without an accent now)

TABACHNICK: Mr. Seinfeld, Agent Stone. FBI. Undercover.

(Jerry looks around for an excape, then makes a mad dash for the door)

KRAMER: No! Jerry! (The FBI agents open fire. Jerry's gunned down by a hailstorm of bullets. Kramer leans next to a fallen Jerry, cupping Jerry's head in his

hands) Cable boy, cable boy.. What have you done to my little cable boy?..

(Scene ends)

[Setting: Airplane]

(Jerry shudders when looking back on his dream. A stewardess approaches)

JERRY: Excuse me. Can I get something to drink?

STEWARDESS: I'm afraid not.

JERRY: What's with this airline? What are you, cutting out the drinks now?

STEWARDESS: No sir. We're flying into a blizzard. Please fasten your seat belt. We're making an emergency landing.

JERRY: (Sarcastic) Are they gonna go over the instructions again?

(The passenger, Bill, next to him offers his hand)

BILL: My name is Bill. I might be the last person you ever see.

(Scene ends)

[Setting: Night club]

JERRY: I'm not afraid of flying, although many people do have fear of flying and, I have no arguement with that. I think fear of flying is quite rational because, human

beings cannot fly. Humans have fear of flying same way fish have fear of driving. Put a fish behind the wheel, and they go, "This isn't right. I shouldn't be doing this. I

don't belong here."

(Scene ends)

[Setting: George's car]

(George is driving while wearing an unzipped coat, and a sweater with a bright red collar under it. Jerry's riding shotgun)

GEORGE: Sounds like a rough trip.

JERRY: Oh, fire engines, ambulances all along the runway. And then, when we landed safely, they all seemed so disappointed.

GEORGE: So, the college cancelled the gig?

JERRY: Well, there was so much snow. The roads were closed. I really appreciate it - you picking me up. Thanks again.

GEORGE: (Modestly) Forget it.

JERRY: No, really.. an airport run.

GEORGE: It's nothing.

JERRY: Hey, it's one thing if I asked you "Could you do me a favor?" ..But to suggest it?.. GEORGE: (Obviously up to something. Jerry doesn't suspect anything -

yet) Whey you told me what you went through on the plane, it makes you stop and think. You appreciate having a real friend.

JERRY: (Joking) You know, if Richie Brandes did this, I'd be suspicious, you know. He's always got some ulterior motive.

GEORGE: (Laughs nervously) ..Ulterior motive.

JERRY: Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Don't take the bridge.. Get off here. We can't go back to my place, Elaine's having the shower.

GEORGE: (Obviously knows that, but pretends he doesn't) What, tonight? Now?

JERRY: Yeah, yeah. I forgot all about it. Alright, it's no big deal. We'll just go back to your place.

GEORGE: My place? NO, no, no. I hate my place. I don't wanna go back to my place.

JERRY: You want to get a bite?

GEORGE: Yeah, I would. It's just, you know, I just ate a whole pot roast.

JERRY: Well, so what should we do?

GEORGE: Shouldn't we at least drop off your bag?

(Jerry's suddenly suspicious. He notices George's red collar, then reaches over and pulls the sweater down)

JERRY: Red shirt! Red shirt! That's the red shirt!

GEORGE: (Nervous) What are you talking about?

JERRY: You're wearing the chocolate shirt!

GEORGE: I am? What a strange coincidence..

JERRY: A - Ha! Nice try, my friend, but you gotta get up pretty early in the morning..

GEORGE: (Pleading) You gotta let me go over there.

JERRY: What are you gonna do? Badger a pregnant woman at her own baby shower?! What are you, gonna take it off and make her rinse it in club soda?

GEORGE: No, I'm gonna hold it under her nose so she can smell the scent of stale Bosco that I had to live with for three years, and I'm gonna say, "Remember this

shirt, baby?! Well, now, it's payback time!"

(Scene ends)

[Setting: Jerry's apartment]

(Leslie is talking to a group of people, including Elaine)

LESLIE: We just bought an apartment on Riverside Drive. Bernard Goetz's mother used to live there.

ELAINE: So, where's Todd?

LESLIE: Up in Hyannisport.

ELAINE: Oh my God, Hyannisport? With the Kennedys? Who else is up there? Is Rose up there?!

WOMAN: (To Leslie) So, when's your due date?

LESLIE: March twentieth, nine a.m.

WOMAN: You know the time!

LESLIE: I'm having a planned C-section. My therapist told me if I go through labor, I might get psychotic.

ELAINE: Leslie, Leslie, whatever happened to Sargent Shriver? Is he still with them? You don't hear much about him these days. Is he out of the loop?

LESLIE: (Takes a bite of food) Elaine, who catered this, Sears?

(Kramer bursts through the door, followed by Tabachnick and his assistant. Tabachnick looks over a woman, and nods approvingly. The woman freeze at the sight,

then disperse nervously)

ELAINE: (Whispering to Kramer) What is this?! What are you doing here?

KRAMER: We're putting in cable.

ELAINE: The cable? No, no, no. I'm having a party here. You can't do this now!

KRAMER: Oh, we have to do this now.

(Tabachnick and his assistant are leering at the women)

ELAINE: Who's this guy?

KRAMER: Which one?

ELAINE: Both of the them.

KRAMER: Oh, they're Soviet Cable guys.

ELAINE: Okay.. Does Jerry know about this?

KRAMER: Oh yeah.. it's all authorized, yeah.

ELAINE: You can't! You can't do this now!

KRAMER: Elaine, do you know how booked up this guy is? Now, if I send him away now, it's gonna take Jerry months to get him back.. He won't like that.

ELAINE: Alright. Just do it fast and then get out.

KRAMER: (Snaps his fingers) Anatoly! (The Russians get to work on command. To Elaine) Look, it's gonna take a few minutes.. Then, you and the gals can take a

load off and watch something on Lifetime.

(Scene ends)

[Setting: George's car]

JERRY: And what if we go up there? What are you going to say to her?

GEORGE: (Boiling) What am I going to say?!

JERRY: Yeah.

GEORGE: What did you go out with me for?! Just to dump chocolate on my shirt and then just dump me altogether?! I don't deserve that kind of treatment! What,

you don't have the common courtesy to return my calls?! To apologize! You think I'm some sort of a loser, that likes to be abused and ignored?! Who's shirt can be

ruined without financial restitution?! Some sort of a masochist who enjoys being humiliated? You think you can avoid me like I have some sort of disease?! You have

the disease! You have the disease! You may be beautiful and rich and physically .. just .. unbelievable, but you sicken me! You disgust me! You and everyone like

you!

JERRY: You'll never say that to her face.

GEORGE: Watch me.

(Scene ends)

[Setting: Jerry's apartment]

KRAMER: (Flirting with a female guest) Yeah, I eat the whole apple. The core, stem, seeds, everything.

ELAINE: (To Kramer) Kramer, Kramer, look at him. (Gestures to Tabachnick) Look! He's eating all the food!

KRAMER: Yeah, yeah. Well, you know, there are many differences between American and Soviet cultures that you're not aware of. See, in Russian, the cable guy,

they got the whole run of the house. Yeah, that's tradition. (Turns back to the woman) Did you ever eat the bark of a pineapple?

(Tabachnick and his assistant start to argue, then they start fighting)

ELAINE: Kramer!

KRAMER: (Trying to break up the fight) Uh.. Excuse me..

(Everyone's watching the fight. Kramer breaks it up. Tabachnick walks to the bathroom while his assistant returns to work. Tabachnick bangs on the door, and

shouts in Russian. A woman finally gets out. Tabachnick gets into the bathroom and slams the door shut. Jerry and George enter. Elaine runs up to greet them)

ELAINE: What are you doing here? I thought you were out of town for the weekend.

JERRY: The show was cancelled. There was a blizzard.

ELAINE: I can't believe you told Kramer it's okay to put the cable in during the shower! Jerry, look,, look! They've eaten everything.

(Leslie approaches them)

LESLIE: Jerry, what a surprise! I thought you sere out of town.

JERRY: Well, Leslie, sometimes the road less travelled is less travelled for a reason.

ELAINE: (Speaking confidentially to George) George, don't even think about it! Don't even dream about it!

GEORGE: (Unconvincingly coy) About what?

TABACHNICK: (Sticks his head out the door) Kramer, Kramer, Kramer..

(Kramer rushes over, and quickly closes the bathroom door as Tabachnick joins his assistant at the food table. George is ready for Leslie - he takes off his sweater,

revealing the chocolate stain. He walks over to Leslie)

GEORGE: Leslie.

LESLIE: Yeah?

GEORGE: George.. (She doesn't seem to recognize him) George Costanza.

LESLIE: Hi.

GEORGE: (Laughs) You, I guess, you don't remember me.. but we actually, kind of um.. went out.. a couple of years ago.. once.. remember?

LESLIE: Vaguely.

GEORGE: You took me to one of your shows..

LESLIE: And?

GEORGE: And, um, it was quite good. In fact, you even incorporated me into the show. I'm not actually a performer. Although, my parents felt I had talent..

(Scene cuts to Jerry)

MARY: Jerry?! (A woman, angry at Jerry, approaches him. Jerry looks confused) Remember me?

JERRY: I'm sorry, I..

MARY: (Livid) Mary Contardi. No? Doesn't ring a bell, Jerry? We had a date, three years ago. You took me to one of your shows.

JERRY: (Stammering) Oh, I, I, think I remember..

MARY: Told me you had a great time! Said you'd call me the next day.

JERRY: Well, I'm sure I meant to call.. I probably just lost your..

MARY: Liar! Liar! You were never going to call me! You thought you could waltz throught the rest of your life and never bump into me again! But you were wrong,

Jerry! You were wrong! What do you think, I'm some sort of poor, pathetic wretch?!

JERRY: No, I don't think that..

MARRY: Some person who could be dismissed and ignored?! Some insignificant piece of dust?! Some person who doesn't deserve your respect and your

attention?! You're the one that doesn't deserve my respect and my attention! You're the insignificant piece of dust!

(She feigns, spitting on the floor near Jerry's shoes, and storms out. Scene cuts to George. Leslie's bored to death)

GEORGE: Actually, I never had any formal training. I guess I'd be better suited for improvs, or something..

(Mary runs for the door, pushing Leslie into George. Her chocolate cake is now all over George's shirt)

LESLIE: Thanks a lot!

(Scene cuts to the front door. Elaine is saying goodbye to a few women who are rushing out the door)

ELAINE: I'm sorry you have to go.

WOMAN: Yeah. I really have to be going.

(Scene cuts to Jerry. He notices the cable guys)

JERRY: Alright, listen, I've changed my mind about this whole thing. I don't want cable.

KRAMER: Don't be a fool.

TABACHNICK: You don't want?

JERRY: No, I don't want. So, just tell me what I owe you for your trouble..

TABACHNICK: (Confers with his assistant, then) Four hundred dollars.

JERRY: (To Kramer) Four hundred dollars?1 You told me one-fifty!

(Scene cuts to Elaine by the door. Leslie has her coat on, and is ready to leave)

LESLIE: I'm going.. obviously.

ELAINE: Oh, Leslie, I am so sorry about everything that went on here tonight. You know, I had no idea..

LESLIE: Elaine, you know, I was watching you tonight, and I realized something. You're just like you were in college.

ELAINE: (Not sure if it was an insult or a compliment) Oh, thank you. (Leslie leaves. Then Elaine wonders to herself) "Like you were in college"?

LESLIE: (Comes back, and yells in the direction of the bedroom) Come on! Let's go!

(George comes out from the bedroom, carrying all the shower gifts - embarrassed)

GEORGE: (Sheepishly to Elaine) I'll be right back. (Leaves)

JERRY: (Defiantly) I'm not paying four hundred dollars! I don't even want the thing. What are you going to do?!

(Scene ends)

[Setting: Jerry's apartment]

(Jerry's TV screen is cracked. George and Elaine are slumped on chairs)

GEORGE: Every woman on the face of the earth has complete control of my life. And yet, I want them all.. is that irony?

ELAINE: Why can't I meet a Kennedy? ..I saw John Junior once downtown. I was on a bus. I hit the ding, but.. it didn't stop.

JERRY: Alright, I said I had a good time and I'd call, but who takes that literally?

KRAMER: (Pops his head into Jerry's apartment) Hey, come on over, Dr. Zhivago's on cable in five minutes.. I'm making popcorn! (Leaves)

(Scene ends)

[Setting: Night club]

JERRY: What do you do at the end of a date when you know you don't want to see this person ever again, for the rest of your life? What do you say? What do you

say? No matter what you say, it's a lie. "I'll see you around. See you around. If you're around, and I'm around, I'll see you around that area. You'll be around other

people. You won't be around me. But you will be around." "Take care now." Did you ever say that to somebody? "Take care now. Take care, now. Because, I'm

not going to be taking care of you. So, you should take care, now." "Take care. Take care." What does this mean? "Take off!" Isn't that what you really want to say?

"Take off now."

END OF SHOW.

Jerry: (A couple of days ago I used a public phone), go over time on the call,

hang up the phone, walk away. You've had this happen? Phone rings. It's the

phone company... they want more money. Don't you love this? And you got them

right where you want them for the first time in your life. You're on the

street, there's nothing they can do. I like to let it ring a few times, you

know, let her sweat a little over there, then I just pick it up, "Yeah,

operator... oh, I got the money... I got the money right here... D'you hear

that? (taps on microphone) That's a quarter. Yeah, you want that don't you?"

(Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant)

Elaine: No, they've just got to get more cops on the force, it's as simple as

that.

George: Cops. I don't even care about cops. I wanna see more garbage men. It's

much more important. All I wanna see are garbage trucks, garbage cans and

garbage men. You're never gonna stop crime, we should at least be clean.

Jerry: I tell you what they should do, they should combine the two jobs, make

it one job, 'cop\garbage man'. I always see cops walking around with nothing to

do. Grab a broom! Start sweeping. You sweep sweep sweep... catch a criminal, get

right back to sweeping.

Elaine: You should run for mayor.

Jerry: Ehh, nobody listens.

Elaine: Where is someone? I'm starving.

George: I think this is him right here.

Elaine: Is there a table ready?

Restaurant Manager (Bruce): How many?

Elaine (to Jerry): How many?

Jerry (to George): Is Tatiana coming?

George: I don't know, I have to call her, tell her where we are. I'm very

lucky she's even considering seeing me at all.

Jerry: Really? I thought things were going OK.

George: They were, it's kinda complicated.

Jerry: Well what is it?

Elaine: How many?

Jerry: Ah, alright, four. Seinfeld.

Bruce: Four. It'll be five, ten minutes.

George: What do you wanna do?

Elaine: Let's go someplace else, I am too hungry.

Jerry: We might as well just stay here, we haven't got that much time if we

wanna make it to the movie.

George: I gotta call Tatiana. where's the phone?

Jerry (to Elaine): Tatiana...

(George goes over to the public phone. There's a guy using it)

George: Excuse me, are you gonna be very long?

(guy on phone just turns the other way without answering)

Bruce: Lashbrook(sp?), 4!

Jerry: So did I do a terrible thing?

Elaine: You mean lying to your uncle?

Jerry: I couldn't have dinner with him. 'Plan 9 from Outer Space', one night

only, the big screen. My hands are tied!

George (to Jerry): You know it's a public phone, you're not supposed to just

chit-chat.

Elaine: Jerry, get menus so when we sit down we can order right away.

Jerry: Can't look at a menu now, I gotta be at the table.

George: He knows I'm waiting. He sees me. He just doesn't wanna look.

Elaine: Everything's gotta be just so with you, doesn't it?

Jerry: Hey, I offered you those cookies in my house.

Elaine: Health cookies. I hate those little dustboard fructose things.

George: I just can't believe at the way people are. What is it with humanity?

What kind of a world do we live in?

(Jerry stares at someone)

Elaine: What?

Jerry: There's a woman over there that looks really familiar. Dark hair,

striped shirt?

Elaine: I've never seen her before.

Jerry: I know this woman. This is gonna drive me crazy.

(a group of people comes in, one of them bumps into Elaine)

Man: Oh, Excuse me.

Elaine: I'm sorry.

(the group just walks right into the dining room)

Elaine: Didja see that? Those people, look, they're getting a table.

Jerry: Well maybe they were here from before.

Elaine: No no no, they weren't here before.

George (to guy): Excuse me, are you going to be much longer? I have to make a

very important call.

(guy on phone turns away again)

Elaine: Find out what's going on!

Jerry: Excuse me, didn't those people just come in? I believe we were ahead of

them.

Elaine: Yeah.

Bruce: What's your name?

Jerry: Seinfeld.

(Bruce starts talking to a Chinese woman in Chinese)

Bruce: No, no, they were here before. Keckitch(sp?), 2!

Elaine: Did you ever notice how happy people are when they finally get a table?

They think they're so special because they've been chosen. It's enough to make

you sick.

Jerry: Boy, you are really hungry.

George (whistles to guy on phone): Hey!

(guy on phone smiles at him and turns back. George, annoyed, goes over to Jerry)

George: If anything happens here, can I count on you?

Jerry: What?

George: If we decide to go at it.

Jerry: Yeah, I wanna get into a rumble...

George: I have to get in touch with Tatiana! And look at his little outfit.

It's all so coordinated, the way his socks matching to his shirt. I really hate

this guy.

Elaine: I'm gonna faint...

Jerry: George, who is that woman in the stripes?

George: I don't know her.

Jerry: She looks so familiar.

Elaine: Ya know, its not fair people are seated First Come First Served, It

should be based on who's hungriest. I feel like just going over there and

taking some food off somebody's plate.

Jerry: I'll tell you what, there's 50 bucks in it for you if you do it.

Elaine: What do you mean?

Jerry: You walk over that table, you pick up an eggroll, you don't say

anything, you eat it, say 'thank you very much', wipe your mouth, walk away- I

give you 50 bucks.

George: What are they gonna do?

Jerry: They won't do anything; in fact, you'll be giving them a story to tell

for the rest of their lives.

Elaine: 50 bucks, you'll give me 50 bucks?

Jerry: 50 bucks. That table over there, the three couples.

Elaine: OK, I don't wanna go over there and do it, and then come back here and

find out there was some little loophole, like I didn't put mustard on it or

something...

Jerry: No, no tricks.

Elaine: Should I do it, George?

George: For 50 bucks? I'd put my face in the soup and blow.

Elaine: Alright, alright. Here, hold this. I'm doin' it.

(Elaine goes over to the table, smiling)

Elaine (through her teeth): I know this sounds crazy, but the two men who are

standing behind me are going to give me 50 bucks if I stand here and eat one of

your eggrolls.

(the people at the table are confused)

Elaine (through teeth): I'll give you 25 if you let me do it.

People at table: What? What is she talking about? What did she say?

(Elaine runs from the table, laughing)

Jerry: What happened?

Elaine: Did you see that?

George: What were you doing?

Elaine (laughing): I offered them 25, they had no idea...

Jerry: George, the phone's free.

George: Alleluia.

(as George reaches for the phone, a woman snatches it and starts dialing)

George: Excuse me, I was waiting here.

Woman at phone: Where? I didn't see you.

George: I've been standing here for the last ten minutes!

Woman: Well I won't be long.

George: That's not the point. The point is I was here first.

Woman: Well if you were here first, you'd be holding the phone.

George (yelling at her): You know, we're living in a society! We're supposed

to act in a civilized way.

(he goes over to Jerry and Elaine)

George: Does she care? No. Does anyone ever display the slightest sensitivity

over the problems of a fellow individual? No. No. A resounding no!

(guy on phone approaches George)

Guy: Hey, sorry I took so long.

George: Oh that's OK, really, don't worry about it.

Elaine: How do people fast? Did Ghandi get this crazy? I'm gonna walk around,

see what dishes look good.

Jerry: I told my uncle I had a stomach ache tonight. You think he bought that?

George: Yeah, well, he probably bought it.

Jerry: So what happened with Tatiana?

George: I shouldn't even tell you this.

Jerry: Come on...

George: Well, after dinner last week, she invites me back to her apartment.

Jerry: I'm with you.

George: Well, it's this little place with this little bathroom. It's like

right there, you know, it's not even down a little hall or off in an alcove.

You understand? There's no... buffer zone. So, we start to fool around, and

it's the first time, and it's early in the going. And I begin to perceive this

impending... intestinal requirement, whose needs are going to surpass by great

lengths anything in the sexual realm. So I know I'm gonna have to stop. And as

this is happening I'm thinking, even if I can somehow manage to momentarily...

extricate myself from the proceedings and relieve this unstoppable force, I know

that that bathroom is not gonna provide me with the privacy that I know I'm

going to need...

Jerry: This could only happen to you.

George: So I finally stop and say, "Tatiana, I hope you don't take this the

wrong way, but I think it would be best if I left".

Jerry: You said this to her after.

George: No. During.

Jerry: Oh, boy.

George: Yeah.

Jerry: Wow! So...?

George: So I'm dressing and she's staring up at me, struggling to compute this

unprecedented turn of events. I don't know what to say to reassure this woman,

and worst of all, I don't have the time to say it. The only excuse she might

possibly have accepted is if I told her I am in reality Batman, and I'm very

sorry, I just saw the Bat-Signal. It took me 3 days of phone calls to get her

to agree to see me again. Now she's waiting for me to call her, and she's

(gestures towards woman on phone) still on the phone.

(Elaine comes over)

Elaine: I hate this place. I don't know why we came here, I'm never coming back

here again.

Jerry (still trying to remember): Who is that woman?!

Elaine: Remember when you first went out to eat with your parents? Remember,

it was such a treat to go and they serve you this different food that you never

saw before, and they put it in front of you, and it is such a delicious and

exciting adventure? And now I just feel like a big sweaty hog waiting for them

to fill up the trough.

George: She's off. (goes over to the now available public phone)

Elaine: Jerry, talk to that guy again.

Jerry: What am I gonna say?

Elaine: Tell him we wanna catch a movie and that we're late.

(as Jerry approaches Bruce, a man walks in)

Mr. Cohen: Hey, what stinks in here?

Bruce (laughing): Mr. Cohen! Haven't seen you for a couple of weeks.

Mr. Cohen: Well, I've been looking for a better place.

(Bruce laughs)

Bruce: Better place... Want a table?

Mr. Cohen: No, just bring me a plate and I'll eat here.

Bruce (laughing): Give him a plate and you eat here... Come on, I give you a

table.

Jerry: Excuse me... we've been waiting here. Now, I KNOW we were ahead of that

guy, he just came in.

Bruce: Oh no, Mr. Cohen always here.

Elaine: He's always here? What does that mean? What does that mean?

Bruce: Oh, Mr. Cohen, very nice man. He live on Park Avenue.

Elaine: Where am I? Is this a dream? What in God's name is going on here?!

George: She's not there. She left. She must've waited and left because those

people wouldn't get off the phone.

Jerry: Didja leave a message?

George: Yeah, I told her to call me here and to tell anyone who answers the

phone to ask for a balding, stocky man with glasses. I better tell him I'm

expecting a call.

Elaine: Oh, Jerry, here comes that woman...

Jerry: Where do I know her?

(woman in stripes approaches Jerry)

Lorraine: Hello, Jerry!

Jerry: Heeeeyyyy... How you doin'?

Lorraine: How is everything?

Jerry: Good, good, good... What's goin' on?

Lorraine: Oh, working hard. And you?

Jerry: Oh, you know, working around, same stuff, doing... whatever.

Lorraine: You haven't been around in a while.

Jerry: I know, I know... Well, you know.

Lorraine: You should come by.

Jerry: Definitely. I plan to, I'm not just saying that.

Elaine: Hi, I'm Elaine.

Lorraine (shaking her hand): Lorraine. Catalano.

Jerry: I'm sorry, Lorraine, this is Elaine...

(They all laugh, then silent)

Lorraine: Well it was nice seeing you, Jerry. And nice meeting you. (she

leaves)

Elaine (smug): Oh, nice to meet you too, Lorraine!

Jerry: Oh my god, Lorraine... that's Lorraine from my uncle's office. I'm in

big, big trouble.

Elaine: The one you broke the plans with tonight?

Jerry: Yeah, she works in his office. Now she's gonna see him tomorrow and

tell him she saw me here tonight. He's gonna tell his wife, his wife's gonna

call my mother. Oh, this is bad, you don't know, the chain reaction of calls

this is gonna set off. New York, Long Island, Florida, it's like the Bermuda

Triangle. Unfortunately, nobody ever disappears. My uncle to my aunt, my aunt

to my mother, my mother to my uncle...

Jerry: ...My uncle to my cousin, my cousin to my sister, my sister to me.

Elaine: You should've just had dinner with your uncle tonight and gotten in

over with. It's just a movie.

Jerry: Just a movie?! You don't understand. This isn't 'Plans 1 through 8

from Outer Space', this is 'Plan 9', this is the one that worked. The worst

movie ever made!

(Elaine nods)

Jerry: Hey, I got news for you, if we're making this movie, we gotta get a

table immediately.

Elaine: Alright, OK. Let's stop fooling around. Let's just slip him some

money.

Jerry: In a Chinese restaurant? Do they take money?

Elaine: Do they take money? Everyone takes money. I used to go out with a guy

who did it all the time, you just slip him 20 bucks.

George: 20 bucks? Isn't that excessive?

Elaine: Well what do you want to give him, change?

George: It's more than the meal!

Jerry: Oh, come on, We'll divide it up three ways.

George: Alright. 7,7, (points at himself) 6. I'm not gonna eat that much!

Jerry: I'm counting your shrimps. OK, Who's gonna do it?

George: Oh no, I can't do it. I-I'm not good at these things, I get flustered.

Once I tried to bribe an usher at the roller derby, I almost got arrested.

Elaine: I guess it's you, Jer.

Jerry: Me? What about you?

Elaine: Oh, I can't do that, it's a guy thing.

Jerry: The woman's movement just can't seem to make any progress in the world

of bribery, can they?

Elaine: Give me the money.

(Elaine stands close to Bruce, trying to get his attention)

Elaine: How's it going'?

Bruce: Very busy.

(Elaine holds the money in front of Bruce)

Elaine: Boy, we are REALLY anxious to sit down.

Bruce: Very good specials tonight.

(Elaine puts the bill on the open reservations book)

Elaine: If there's anything you can do to get us a table we'd really appreciate

it.

Bruce: What is your name? (he turns the page over the money)

Elaine: No no, I want to eat now! (she gets the money from under the page)

Bruce: Yes, we have sea-bass dinner tonight, very fresh.

Elaine (Gives him the money): Here, take this. I'm starving. Take it! Take

it!

(Bruce shrugs and takes it)

Bruce: Dennison, 4! (goes over to 4 ladies) Your table is ready.

Elaine: No no, no, I want that table. I want that table! Oh, come on, did you

see that? What was that? He took the money, he didn't give us a table.

Jerry: You lost the 20.

Elaine: Well, how could he do that?

George: You didn't make it clear.

Elaine: Make it clear?

Jerry: What a sorry exhibition that was. Alright, let me get the money back.

(goes over to Bruce) Excuse me. I realize, this is extremely embarrassing, my

friend here apparently made a mistake.

Bruce: Your name?

Jerry: Seinfeld.

Bruce: Yeah, Seinfeld 4!

Jerry: No no no, you see the girl there, with the long hair?

(Elaine waves at him, smiling)

Bruce: Oh yes, yes. Very beautiful girl, very beautiful. Is your girlfriend?

Jerry: Well, actually, we did date for a while, but... it's really not relevant

here.

Bruce: Relationships are difficult. It's very hard to stay together-

Jerry: Alright, listen, alright. How much longer is it gonna be?

Bruce: Oh. In about five, ten minutes.

(Jerry goes over to Elaine and George)

George: So?

Jerry: There seems to be a bit of a discrepancy.

Elaine: So when are we gonna eat?

Jerry: Five, ten minutes.

George: We should have left earlier. I told you.

Jerry: I don't see any way we can eat and make this movie.

Elaine: Oh, well I have to eat.

Jerry: Well let's just order to go, we'll eat it in the cab.

Elaine: Eat it in the cab? Chinese food in a cab?

Jerry: We'll eat it in the movie.

Elaine: Oh, who do you think you're going? Do you think that they have big

picnic tables there?

Jerry: Well what do you suggest?

Elaine: I say we leave now, we go to 'Skyburger' and we scarf 'em down.

Jerry: I'm not going to 'Skyburger'. Besides, it's in the opposite direction,

let's just eat popcorn or something.

Bruce (holding a phone): Cartwright?

Elaine: I can't have popcorn for dinner!

Bruce: Cartwright?

Elaine (tries to snatch food off a waiter's tray): I have to eat!

Jerry: So they have hotdogs there.

Elaine: Oh, movie hotdogs! I rather lick the food off the floor.

George: I can't go anywhere, I have to wait here for Tatiana's call. Let me

just check.

(goes over to Bruce)

George: Excuse me, I'm expecting a call. Costanza?

Bruce: Yeah, I just got a call. I yell 'Cartwright! Cartwright!', just like

that. Nobody came up, I hang up.

George: Well, was it for Costanza or...

Bruce: Yes, yes, that's it. Nobody answered.

George: Well was it a woman?

Bruce: Yeah, yeah. I tell her you not here, she said curse word, I hang up.

(George comes over to Jerry and Elaine, stunned)

George: She called. He yelled Cartwright. I missed her.

Jerry: Who's Cartwright?

George: I'm Cartwright!

Jerry: You're not Cartwri-

George: Of course I'm not Cartwright! Look, why don't you two just go to the

movies all by yourselves, I'm not in the mood.

Elaine: Well me neither, I'm goin' to 'Skyburger'.

Jerry: So You're not going?

Elaine: You don't need us.

Jerry: Well I can't go to a bad movie by myself. Who am I gonna make sarcastic

remarks to, strangers? Eh, I guess I'll just go to my uncle's.

George: Should we tell him we're leaving?

Elaine: What for? Let's just get out of here.

(they all leave)

Bruce: Seinfeld, 4?

(closing monologue)

Jerry: Hunger will make people do amazing things. I mean, the proof of that is

cannibalism. Cannibalism, what do they say, I mean, they're eating and, you

know, "This is good, who is this? I like this person". You know, I mean, I

would think the hardest thing about being a cannibal is trying to get some very

deep sleep, you know what I mean? I would think, you'd be like, (pretending to

wake up) "Who is that? Who's there? Who's there? Is somebody there? What do

you want? What do you want? You look hungry, are you hungry? Get out of

here!"

(credits roll; THE END)

[Setting: Night club]

JERRY: I'm not a foodie. I don't, "Oh, this is too rare. Oh, it's too salty." Just eat it and shut up. I'll eat anywhere, whatever they're having. I have eaten rotten rolls

off of room service trays in hotel hallways. I have. It's not a joke. This is my life. I don't know, somebody left it. Why would someone poison a roll, and leave it in a

hallway for some comic coming down at two o' clock in the morning? Why would they do that? Sometimes you go to a nice restaurant, they put the check in a little

book. What is this? The story of the bill? "Once upon a time, there were some very hungry people.." What is this? A little gold tassle hanging down? Am I graduating

from the restaurant? What is this about?

(Scene ends)

[Setting: A restaurant]

(Jerry, George, and Elaine are all eating at an Italian restaurant. George hasn't eaten anything)

ELAINE: Do you want some of mine?

JERRY: Take some of mine.

GEORGE: Why do I get pesto? Why do I think I'll like it? I keep trying to like it, like I have to like it.

JERRY: Who said you have to like it?

GEORGE: Everybody likes pesto. You walk into a restaurant, that's all you hear - pesto, pesto, pesto.

JERRY: I don't like pesto.

GEORGE: Where was pesto 10 years ago?

JERRY: (Gesturing to a man) Look at that guy. (Elaine starts to look, but Jerry stops her) I'll bet you he's gettin' hair transplants. Any time you see a guy that age

wearing a baseball cap, ten to one - plugs.

ELAINE: (Elaine turns to look at the man, trying to make it sound like they aren't talking about him) The thing about that painting.. is with the colors and um.. (Turns

back to Jerry) Oh yeah, plugola.

(George has started eating Elaine's food - and continues to do so)

JERRY: (To Elaine) Oh, one more thing about the car. Let it warm up for a minute.

GEORGE: That's a tough minute. It's like waiting in the shower for the conditioner to work.

JERRY: I don't understand why he couldn't take a cab.

GEORGE: Who?

JERRY: Elaine is having a "houseguest." She's picking him up at the airport tonight.

GEORGE: A guy?

ELAINE: (Slightly embarrassed) Yes, a guy.

JERRY: He's from a.. Yakima, right?

ELAINE: Seattle.

JERRY: Everybody's moving to Seattle.

GEORGE: It's the pesto of cities. So..?

ELAINE: (To Jerry) You tell him.

JERRY: Well, from what I can piece together, our friend here met a gentleman.

ELAINE: Ed.

JERRY: Who was in town on a business venture, and um..

ELAINE: ..We shared an interpersonal experience. (George hits his glass with his fork. To Jerry) Go on.

JERRY: So they went out a few times, but apparently, when the fellow returned home, he discovered that the Benes tattoo does not wash off so easily.

ELAINE: On some people.

GEORGE: Oooh.

JERRY: So, he's coming in to stay with her for a week.

ELAINE: It was just gonna be a weekend, but then somehow it became a week.

(The menu at a neighboring table catches fire. Elaine quickly picks up a wine glass - about to put it out, but George tosses the menu on the floor, and stomps it out.

The manager approaches)

MANAGER: What happened?

GEORGE: Oh, the busboy left the menu a little close to the candle.

MANAGER: Sorry to the disturbance.

ELAINE: (Joking, she snobbishly says) I'm never eating here again.

(Manager leaves)

JERRY: (Pats George on the back) Nice going. Thank you, that ought to get us a free dessert.. (They can see the manager chewing the busboy out from the dining

room doorway) I think the busboy's in trouble.

GEORGE: Did I get him in trouble? Because of what I said?! I just told him what happened.. he didn't do it on purpose.. (Mangager and busboy are arguing. The

busboy points in the direction of George) He pointed at me. Why did he point at me?!

ELAINE: I said I would never eat here again.. But, I, I.. he had to know I was kidding.

JERRY: (Casually buttering a roll, like he's the innocent one) I didn't say anything.

(The busboy takes of his apron, throws it down, and exits the restaurant)

GEORGE: I can't believe it. He's going! He's fired!

ELAINE: Oh, I said it in a kidding way.

GEORGE: I didn't know he'd get fired.

JERRY: (Jokingly trying to put more pressure on Elaine and George) He'll probably kill his family over this.

GEORGE: What if he's waiting for me outside? He pointed at me! Did you see him point?!

JERRY: (Again, joking) A lot of ex-cons become busboys. They seem to gravitate twards 'em.

GEORGE: Was it my fault?

ELAINE: Was it my fault?

JERRY: (Doesn't have a care in the world) ..Maybe I'll try that pesto.

(Scene ends)

[Setting: Jerry's apartment]

JERRY: Look, I feel bad for him too, but he'll get another job. I mean, let's face it, it's not a profession where you embellish your resume and undergo a series of

grueling interviews.

GEORGE: (Eating a sandwich) Oh, like you really know busboys.

JERRY: Oh, like you do.

GEORGE: Hey, at least I was a camp waiter.

JERRY: (Scoffing) Camp.

GEORGE: It was a fat camp. Those kids depended on me.

(The intercom buzzes, Jerry talks through it)

JERRY: Elaine?

ELAINE: (Through intercom) Yeah.

(Jerry pushes a button on the intercom - letting her in)

JERRY: Busboys are always changing jobs. That's the business. I know. I work with these guys. I tallk to them in the kitchen at the comedy clubs.

GEORGE: Then why don't you try and get him another job?

JERRY: I'd love to, but I don't know anything about him. He could be one of those people that walks around the street pricking people with pins.

(Elaine enters)

ELAINE: I don't know if you people are aware of this, but I am one clever chickadee.

GEORGE: What? Did you get the busboy's number?

ELAINE: His phone's been disconnected, but I was able to obtain an address - 1324 Amsterdam Avenue, apartment 4D. (Hands George a card) Now, I did my

job. (To Jerry) May I have the car keys, please?

(Jerry hands the car keys to Elaine)

GEORGE: How did you get all this?

ELAINE: Does the word "charm" mean anything to you?

JERRY: No. (George grabs his jacket) So now you're going to his apartment? I really think this is nuts.

GEORGE: (Putting his jacket on) I'd like to apologize. I want to tell him I.. I.. didn't mean to get him in trouble.

JERRY: You, you're going now?

GEORGE: Yeah, I want to see if there's anything I can do.. maybe get him another job.. maybe I'll hear of something.

JERRY: Maybe the fat camp. (To Elaine) You're not going?

ELAINE: I would, but I have to pick up Ed at the airport.

JERRY: I just don't think you should go alone. Can't you wait till after my set?

GEORGE: It'll take to long.

(Kramer enters)

JERRY: Take the K-man. A little support..

GEORGE: (Unsure) I don't a..

KRAMER: Take me where? Where?

(Scene ends)

[Setting: An apartment building hallway]

(George's nervous - standing with Kramer infront of the busboy's apartment)

GEORGE: Look, I really appreciate your coming, but if you wouldn't mind - try not to say too much.

KRAMER: What am I gonna say?

GEORGE: I don't know.

KRAMER: Well, I'm not an idiot.

GEORGE: Certainly not.

KRAMER: Then we're cool.

GEORGE: Yeah.. yeah, we're - we're cool. (Knocks lightly. Kramer takes charge by knocking on the door louder. The busboy answers) Uh, I'm sorry to bother

you, I was in the restaurant earlier and I was wondering if I could talk to you for a few minutes about what happened. (He gestures for them to come in. They obey)

I hope I'm not interrupting anything. It's just that I think I may have - without realizing it - been responsible for getting you fired. (Nervously laughs) And.. and.. and I

just want you to know that I didn't intend for that to happen.

KRAMER: (Patting George on the shoulder) He's a hell of a guy.

GEORGE: This is a guy I know.. Kramer.

(Antonio, the busboy, is watching them suspiciously)

KRAMER: Habla espanol?

GEORGE: (To himself) Oh my God.

ANTONIO: Si.

KRAMER: Como se dice.. waterbed?

GEORGE: (Interrupting) Anyway, I just wanted to let you know I'm really sorry that happened, and if I can help out in any way, I'll certainly be glad to do that.

(Pause) Well, I guess that's about it.

KRAMER: You got anything to drink? Agua?

GEORGE: Oy uy uy.. (Antonio points to the sink) We really should get going.

KRAMER: Let me get a glass of water. (Heads tward the sink)

GEORGE: Hurry up.

ANTONIO: (Notices that his cat is missing) Pequita? Pequita? (Starts to panic)

KRAMER: His cat's gone.

ANTONIO: (Notes the door was left wide open) La puerta esta abierta. (Starts screaming) La puerta esta abierta! (To Kramer and George) Who left the door

open? (Silence) Who left the door open?! (Kramer and George look at eachother) Come on, come on! Help me look! (All three head out the door to look)

(Scene ends)

[Setting: Antonio's apartment]

(All three sit in silence)

KRAMER: ..You know, cats run away all the time. You know, my aunt, she had a cat. Ran away. Showed up three years later.. you never know. They got things in

their brains where they remember where they're from. Unless, of course, somebody else starts feeding him. See, that's what you gotta worry about.

GEORGE: (Gestures for Kramer to shut up) Once again, Antonio, I can't even begin to say how deeply, deeply sorry I am about everything. The job, the cat.. (A

lamp breaks) the lamp.

KRAMER: The wire was sticking out.. (Fits the two broken pieces together) Yeah.

GEORGE: (Hands Antonio a card) Here's my card. I'm in real estate, so, if you're ever looking for something bigger, something nicer.. (Antonio is staring at him,

angered) ..maybe not right now. Anyway.. (Extends his hand for a handshake. Antonio doesn't move)

KRAMER: You oughta get that wire fixed. (They go to leave) I got the door. (Shuts the door, the broken lamp falls to the floor)

(Scene ends)

[Setting: Jerry's apartment]

JERRY: (On the phone) George, stop worrying about this guy. It wasn't your fault.. Come on, he's not stalking you.

(Kramer enters)

KRAMER: Hey.

JERRY: (To Kramer) Hey. (To George) He doesn't even know where you live.. Who told you to give him your business card?.. (Intercom buzzes) That's Elaine.

(Kramer buzzes her in. Jerry talks into the phone) Kramer.. (To Kramer) George wants to know when you want to look for the cat again.

KRAMER: It's been a week. It's up to the cat now.

JERRY: (Into phone) Kramer says it's up to the cat now. (To Kramer) It'll be on your conscience.

KRAMER: Oh? How do you figure?

JERRY: (Into phone) How do you figure? (To Kramer) 'Cause you're the one who left the door open.

KRAMER: Why was I in charge of closing the door?

JERRY: (Into phone) Why was he in charge of closing the door? (Irritated at the phone message relay, to Kramer) 'Cause you came in after him!

KRAMER: So!

JERRY: (Into phone) So! (To Kramer - getting even more angry) So, the last person in should close the door!

KRAMER: Let me talk to him.

JERRY: (To Kramer) Talk - call him from your house. (Elaine enters. Kramer leaves. To phone) He's calling you now.. okay. (Hangs up)

ELAINE: Ed's downstairs. CAn I have the car keys?

(Jerry pitches her the keys as she goes some tward his bathroom)

JERRY: No hello?

ELAINE: Got any asprin? (Finds some) Hello. Now, lookit, you guarantee this car will get me to the airport tomarrow? No problems?

JERRY: Guarantee? ..Hey, it's a car.

ELAINE: Because if there's even the slightest chance of any problem at all, I don't want to take it - because if I don't get this guy on a plane to Seattle and out of my

life, I'm gonna kill him, and everyone who tries to stop me.

JERRY: (Jokingly asking) So, did you have a nice week together?

ELAINE: I heard a little ping in the car last time. What was that ping?

JERRY: There's no ping. Why are you so wacky?

ELAINE: Jerry, you cannot imagine how much I hate this guy.. and he hasn't even done anything! It's the situation. He's a wonderful guy, but I hate his guts!

JERRY: So, you two been, uh..

ELAIEN: No! I told him I've been having my period for the last five days! I'm sleeping all squished over on the edge of my bed.. But, I've only got fourteen hours to

go. Nothing can go wrong now. I think I've taken care of everything. I've confirmed the plane reservation. I've checked the weather..

JERRY: What's your airport route?

ELAINE: I've got it all mapped out - I'm taking the tunnel.

JERRY: ..What about the Van Wyck?

ELAINE: I spoke to a cab driver. For five bucks, he turned me on to the Rockaway Boulevard shortcut.

JERRY: Oooh.

ELAINE: Now, lookit, this plane leaves at 10:15. We're getting up at about eight. That gives us enough time, right?

JERRY: You still using that old alarm clock?

ELAIEN: Oh, no, no. I bought a new one today. It's got everything - it's got everything... If you oversleep more than ten minutes, a hand comes out and slaps you in

the face.

(Scene ends)

[Setting: Night club]

JERRY: Flying doesn't make me nervous - driving to the airport can make you very nervous because when you're flying, when you're getting on the plane, if you miss

that plane, there's no alternative. On the ground, you have options. You have buses, you have taxis, you have trains. But, when you're taking a flight, if you miss it,

that's it. No airline goes, "Well, you missed the flight, we do have a cannon leaving in about ten minutes. Would you be interested in that? It's not a direct cannon,

you have to change cannons after you land." (Imitates cannon operator) "I'm sorry, where you goin'? Chicago? (Cranks the cannon) Oh, Dallas? Alright, wait a

second.. (Cranks cannon to Dallas) Dallas. That's about Dallas. Texas, anyway. You should hit Texas. Are you ready? Make sure you get out of the net

immediately, because we shoot the luggage in right after you."

(Scene ends)

[Setting: Elaine's apartment]

(Elaine and Ed are in bed. Elaine awakes to find out that it's 9:15 - they overslept. She gets frantic)

ELAINE: (Trying to wake Ed up) Get up! The alarm clock didn't go off! (Shakes him) It's 9:15! You're gonna miss the plane! It's 9:15!

ED: 9:15?

ELAINE: Yes! 9:15!

ED: (Going back to sleep) We'll never make it. I'll leave tomarrow.

ELAINE: Tomarrow?! Are you crazy? No, now, now! Let's go! (Gets his suitcase from the closet, throws it on the bed, and frantically starts packing) You get

dressed! Get dressed!

ED: Can I shower?

ELAINE: Shower?! ARe you out of your mind?!

ED: I gotta shower. I'll feel dirty all day.

ELAINE: Forget the shower! The shower's out. Move it! Put your clothes on! Put your clothes on! (Pulls out drawers of clothes, turning them over in the suitcase.

He walks tward the door) Where are you going?

ED: The kitchen.

ELAINE: The kitchen?!

ED: I've got a bag of cashews in there.

ELAINE: They're not making it! Let's get your pants on!

ED: What's the big deal if we don't make it? I'll just go tomarrow or the next day.

ELAINE: No! You have your ticket! You have to go now!

ED: I'll never make it.

ELAINE: Don't say that!

ED: But it takes forty-five minutes to get there. That'll only leave me five minutes to get to the plane.

ELAINE: Shut up and pack!

ED: And what if I don't make the plane? You'll have already left. Then what will I do?

ELAINE: You're talking too much!

ED: Where's my sweater?

ELAINE: What?!

ED: My brown sweater.

ELAINE: What? What sweater?

ED: My brown sweater.

ELAINE: You didn't bring a brown sweater.

ED: I brought a brown sweater.

ELAINE: Here! Here! You want a brown sweater?! (Recahes into one of her drawers, and grabs a brown sweater, then packs it) You got a brown sweater!

ED: That's not mine. I can't take your sweater.

ELAINE: It's brown! (Takes clothes still on the hangers, and dumps them into the suitcase)

ED: What are you doing?!

ELAINE: NO time for folding.. (Looks around) I think that's it. (Zips up the suitcase)

ED: My shoes. You packed my shoes.

ELAINE: Shoes? Shoes?! Shoes?! Shoes weren't invented till the fourth century! People walked around for thousands of years without them! (Puts her coat on over

her nightie. He picks up his suitcase, she grabs it from him, then pushes him out of her way) I got this. Let's go!

(Scene ends)

[Setting: Jerry's apartment]

JERRY: Anywhere in the city?

GEORGE: Anywhere in the city - I'll tell you the best public toilet.

JERRY: Okay.. Fifty-fourth and Sixth?

GEORGE: Sperry Rand Building. 14th floor, Morgan Apparel. Mention my name - she'll give you the key.

JERRY: Alright.. Sixty-fifth and Tenth.

GEORGE: (Scoffs) ARe you kidding? Lincoln Center. Alice Tully Hall, the Met. Magnificent facilities.

(Elaine enters. She's still wearing her nightclothes under her coat. Her hair is messed up. She's been through quite an ordeal)

ELAINE: (Slow, as if remember a dream) I never new I could drive like that. I was going faster than I've ever gone before, and yet, it all seemed to be happening in

slow motion. I was seeing three and four moves ahead, weaving in and out of lanes like an Olympic skier on a gold metal run. I knew I was challenging the very laws

of physics. At Queens Boulevard, I took the shoulder. At Jewel Avenue, I used the median. I had it. I was there.. and then.. I hit the Van Wyck. They say no one's

ever beaten the Van Wyck, but gentlemen, I tell you this - I came as close as anyone ever has. And if it hadn't been for that five-car-pile-up on Rockaway

Boulevard, that numbskull would be on a plane for Seattle right now instead of looking for a parking space downstairs.

(Kramer enters)

KRAMER: ..The busboy's coming! The busboy's coming!

GEORGE: The busboy's coming?

JERRY: You don't mean here?

KRAMER: Yeah. I just buzzed him in. He's on his way up..

GEORGE: He's coming up?! (Moves to the door) I'll check you out later.

JERRY: Where are you going?

GEORGE: I'm the one he wants! He's coming to settle the score.

JERRY: (Trying to get George and Kramer out) No. You three all know each other. There's no point in me getting involved at this stage of the game.

KRAMER: No, he's not going to do anything. I guarantee it.

GEORGE: Oh, the hell with it. Let him kill me. I..

(There's a knock in the hallway)

KRAMER: Antonio. In here!

(Antonio enters)

GEORGE: (Nervous, his voice cracks) Hey, Antonio. How's it going?

(Antonio crosses over to George, and gives him a hug)

ANTONIO: Three nights ago, a gas main beneath the restaurant exploded, killing five people in my section, including the busboy who replaced me. If I am not fired

that night because of you and your thoughtless, stupid, insensitive remarks, it would have been me. You saved my life. (Hugs him again)

GEORGE: (Trying to be modest) Ah, come on..

(The intercom buzzes)

ELAINE: (Into the intercom) Yeah?

ED: It's Eddie.

ELAINE: He's coming up. (Buzzes him in) He's coming up..

ANTONIO: And that very same night of the accident, while looking for Pequita, I found a job in a restaurant where they pay me almost twice what I was making

before - and when I returned to the apartment, Pequita, perhaps frightened from the explosion, had miraculously returned. Well, but now, I must go, for today I am

starting my new and wonderful job. And I am very late. Thank you, thank you, thank you all. (Leaves)

(Everyone ad-libs congratulations to George. Then, we hear a fight erupting from the hallway)

ED: Hey, watch were you're going. You almost knocked my head off!

ANTONIO: Hey, why don't you watch where you're going, okay? 'Cause you bumped into me!

ED: Who do you think you're talking to, pal?

ANTONIO: Hey, get your hands off me!

ED: Go to hell!

(Antonio screams out profanity in Spanish, then we hear them getting into a serious fight)

(Scene ends)

[Setting: Coffee shop]

JERRY: He'll get another job. He's a busboy!

GEORGE: It won't for a while. At least not until after the cast comes off.

JERRY: It was that fall down the stairs. That's what did it.

GEORGE: That's not how it happened. It's when he fell on him with his knee.

ELAINE: Oh, that was awful. Poor Antonio. (Waiter hands Elaine two bags of food to go) ..Thanks.

GEORGE: So, much longer?

ELAINE: Till when - till he goes back to Seattle, or till he can feed himself?

GEORGE: (Not wanting to make Elaine mad) I guess it's not important.

ELAINE: Take care of yourselves. (Leaves)

GEORGE: I should probably get going too. If I don't feed Pequita by seven, she goes all over everything.. take it easy.

JERRY: Yeah.. (Takes a bite of his sandwich as the waiter starts cleaning off the table) How ya doing?

(Scene ends)

[Setting: Night club]

JERRY: First of all, I can't believe that people actually do fight. People have fist fights in life. I can't really believe that we have boxing either. It's really kind of an

amazing thing. To me, the problem with boxing is - you have two guys having a fight that have no prior argument. Why don't they have the boxers come into the ring

in little cars, drive around a bit, have a little accident? They get out, "Didn't you see my signal?" "Look at that fender!" ..Then you'd see a real fight.

END OF SHOW.

Every time somebody recommends a doctor, he's always the best.  "Oh, is he
good?"  "Oh, he's the best.  This guy's the best."  They can't all be the best.
There can't be this many bests.  Someone's graduating at the bottom of these
classes, where are these doctors?  Is somewhere, someone saying to their friend,
"You should see my doctor, he's the worst.  Oh yeah, he's the worst, he's the
absolute worst there is.  Whatever you've got, it'll be worse after you see him.
He's just, he's a butcher.  The man's a butcher."?  And then there's always
that, "Make sure that you tell him that, you know, you know me."  Why?  What's
the difference?  He's a doctor.  What is it, "Oh, you know Bob!  Okay, I'll give
you the real medicine.  Everybody else, I'm giving Tic-Tacs."


First scene.
Jerry is getting a massage.

Julianna:  ...And usually for lunch I'll have a salad, and for dinner, I eat
whatever I want.

Jerry:  What do you think the worst part of being blind is?

Julianna:  Excuse me?

Jerry:  You know, if you were blind what do you think the worst part of it would
be?

Julianna:  I don't know.

Jerry:  I think it would be not being able to tell if there was bugs in my food.
How could you ever enjoy a meal like that?  I'd constantly be feeling around
with my lips and my tongue.

Julianna:  Well that's how my five-year old eats.  He's a very picky eater.

Jerry:  You hear about that kid that was kidnapped the other day in
Pennsylvania?

Julianna:  No.

Jerry:  He was at a carnival with his mother.  She goes to get a hot dog, next
thing you know she turns around, boom, he's gone.

Julianna:  Oh.

Jerry:  Imagine how sick a person has to be to do something like that.  And
these people are all over the place.  You never know who's crazy, I could be one
of these people.

Julianna (visibly uncomfortable):  Have you seen any good movies?

Jerry:  Who takes care of your boy during the day?

Julianna:  We have a woman.  Why?

Jerry:  No no.  I'm just saying.

Julianna:  She had references.

Jerry:  I'm sure she did, I'm sure they're impeccable.  I'm talking about the
ones that forge them.  You know I think this is really helping.

Julianna:  I don't live near here, ya know!



New scene.
Jerry, Elaine and George are at Jerry's apartment.

Jerry:  So she's giving me the massage and I'm just making conversation.

Elaine:  I don't like to talk during a massage.

Jerry:  Neither do I, but I do it for them.  I figure they're bored.

George:  Yeah, I do that too.  I feel guilty about getting the pleasure.  I feel
like I don't deserve it so I talk.  It stops me from enjoying it.  There's
nothing to eat in here.

Elaine:  Oh!  I forgot to tell you--

Jerry:  I'm in the middle of a story.

Elaine:  Okay, go ahead.

George:  Why don't you ever go shopping?

Jerry:  Not like it's a really funny story or anything.

Elaine:  What happened?

Jerry:  Well so she mentioned that she had a son, and the for some reason I
launch into the story about the kid from Pennsylvania who was abducted.

Elaine:  Oh, wasn't that terrible?

Jerry:  Yes, it was.

George:  Not even an apple.

Elaine:  She doesn't want to hear that, that was stupid.

Jerry:  I know it was stupid.

Elaine:  Really stupid.

Jerry:  Hey, I just said it was stupid.

George:  What about this leftover Chinese food?

Jerry:  Take it.

Elaine:  I can't believe you said that.

Jerry:  Hey, would you stop it already?

Elaine:  So, what did she say?

Jerry:  I don't know, she actually seemed to get a little paranoid.

George:  This is terrible.  What is this, ginger?  I hate ginger.  I can't
understand how anyone can eat ginger.

Elaine:  I have a good masseuse you could go to.

Jerry:  Nah, she's really good and she's not just a masseuse, she's a physical
therapist.  There's a big difference.  She uses the ultrasound, it's a real
medical procedure.  In fact, if you get a doctor's note, it's covered by
insurance.

George:  Physical therapy is covered by insurance?

Jerry:  Yeah.

George:  You don't have to pay for the massage?

Jerry:  Not if you have a doctor's note.

Elaine:  So where do you get this note?

Jerry:  Well I've never actually done it but if I really wanted to I could
probably get one from my friend Roy, the dentist.

George:  Right, your friend Roy.

Elaine:  What's the name of this physical therapist?

Jerry:  I'll tell you, but don't ask her anything about her kid, she a little
off.


George:  And you don't have to pay.


New scene.
George and Elaine are at the physical therapist's office.

George:  We have three-o'clock appointments.

Receptionist:  George and Elaine, right?  Could you fill these out for me
please?  And Elaine, you'll be seeing Julianna, and George, you'll be with
Raymond.

George:  Excuse me, did you say 'Raymond'?

Receptionist:  Yes.

George:  But, uh, Raymond is a man.

Receptionist:  That's right.

George sits down slowly, letting this sink in.

George:  I can't get a massage from a man.

Elaine:  Why not?

George:  What, are you crazy?  I can't have a man touching me.  Switch with me.

Elaine:  No, I don't want the man either.

George:  What's the difference, you're a woman.  They're supposed to be touching
you.

Elaine:  He'd just be touching your back.

George:  He'd just be touching your back too.

Elaine:  No, it could get sexual.

George:  I know.  That's the point.  If it's gonna get sexual, it should get
sexual with you.

Elaine:  I wouldn't be comfortable.

George:  I would?  What if something happens?

Elaine:  What could happen?

George:  What if it felt good?

Elaine:  It's supposed to feel good.

George:  I don't want it to feel good.

Elaine:  Then why get the massage?

George:  Exactly!

A man walks up dressed in white.

Raymond:  George?

George:  Yes?

Raymond:  I'm Raymond.

George:  Hello.

Raymond:  Are you ready?

George gets up cautiously and walks with Raymond.


New scene.
George is on the table getting a massage from Raymond.  George appears extremely
uncomfortable.

Raymond:  ...And then Julianna asked me if I wanted to join her here in the
office.

George:  Really.

Raymond:  I used to be a flight attendant.

George:  Oh boy.

Raymond:  Ya know, why don't you open those pants, it's gonna be a lot easier
that way.

George loosens his pants, Raymond grabs them and yanks then down his hips then
starts massaging his lower back.

Raymond:  So what do you do?

George:  What?

Raymond:  I said, 'What do you do?'.

George:  I don't know.

Raymond:  You don't know what you do?

George:  Nah.

Raymond:  Oh, come on.  Hey, you're very tense.

George:  Coffee.  Too much coffee.

Raymond:  Okay, just take off those pants now, I'll work the hamstring.

George:  Oh, the hamstring's fine.

Raymond:  But you wrote that it was tender.

George:  I wrote.  Pfft, *I* wrote.

Raymond:  I'll check it out.

George:  Are you sure?

Raymond:  Yeah, take 'em off.

George gets up to remove his pants, he looks over and sees Raymond rubbing his
hands with oil.  Nervous, George pulls his pants down and climbs back on the
table.  As soon as Raymond touches his leg, George becomes rigid with
discomfort.

Raymond:  How did you hurt this?

George:  I don't know.

Raymond:  You don't know?

George:  No.

Raymond:  But you just told me--

George:  Korea.

Raymond:  You hurt it in Korea?

George:  What?

Raymond:  The hamstring.

George:  Korea.

Raymond:  How?

George:  Hamstring.

Raymond:  How did you hurt the hamstring?

George:  Hotel.


New scene.
Elaine is in the waiting room, George walks out very slowly, he appears
positively shell-shocked.

Elaine:  How'd it go?  George?

George walks right out the door, ignoring Elaine.


New scene.
Jerry's apartment, Jerry is on the phone.

Jerry:  No appointments at all?  Because my neck is still tight.  What about
Thursday?  And Friday?  Oh boy.  Okay, thanks anyway.

George enters acting nervous.

Jerry:  What's with you?

George:  A...

Jerry:  Yes, A...?

George:  A man gave me...

Jerry:  Yes, a man gave you...?

George:  A man gave me... a massage.

Jerry:  So?

George:  So he... had his hands and, uh, he was...

Jerry:  He was what?!

George:  He was... touching and rubbing.

Jerry:  That's a massage.

George:  And then I took my pants off.

Jerry:  You took your pants off?


George:  For my hamstring.

Jerry:  Oh.

George:  He got about two inches from... there.

Jerry:  Really?

George:  I think it moved.

Jerry:  Moved?

George:  It may have moved, I don't know.

Jerry:  I'm sure it didn't move.

George:  It moved!  It was imperceptible but I felt it.

Jerry:  Maybe it just wanted to change positions?  You know, shift to the other
side.

George:  No, no.  It wasn't a shift, I've shifted, this was a move.

Jerry:  Okay, so what if it moved?

George:  That's the sign!  The test; if a man makes it move.

Jerry:  That's not the test.  Contact is the test, if it moves as a result of
contact.

George:  You think it's contact?  It has to be touched?

Jerry:  That's what a gym teacher once told me.

Kramer enters.

Kramer:  Hey.

Jerry:  Hey.

Kramer:  I just saw Joe DiMaggio in Dinky Donuts.  You know, I looked in there
and there he was having coffee and a donut.

Jerry:  Joe DiMaggio?  In Dinky Donuts?

Kramer:  Yeah.  Joe DiMaggio.

Jerry:  I'm sorry, if Joe DiMaggio wants a donut he goes to a fancy restaurant
or a hotel.  He's not sitting in Dinky Donuts.

Kramer:  Well maybe he likes Dinky Donuts.

George:  I don't even like to sit next to a man on an airplane 'cause our knees
might touch.

Jerry:  I can't see Joe DiMaggio sitting at the counter in little tiny filthy
smelly Dinky Donuts.

Kramer:  Why can't Joe DiMaggio have a donut like everyone else?

Jerry:  He can have a donut, but not at Dinky.

George:  I don't even like to use urinals, I've always been a stall man.

Kramer:  Look I'm telling-- (he does a double take and looks at George)  I'm
telling you, that was Joe DiMaggio.

George:  The guy slept with Marilyn Monroe, he's in Dinky Donuts.  What about
this doctor's note?  Let's go see your friend Roy.

Jerry:  I never said I'd do that.

George:  What are you talking about, that's seventy-five bucks!  I'm not
working, I can't afford that.

Jerry:  I don't know how I feel about it.

George:  Oh, what are you, like, a Quaker now?

Jerry:  Alright, alright.

Kramer:  A stall man, huh?


New scene.
George and Jerry are in Roy's office.

Jerry:  ...so we were just kinda wondering if it was possible for you to write
us a note, and if you can't, believe me, it's fine.

George:  He didn't say he can't.

Jerry:  I mean, if you feel funny about it at all.

George:  He doesn't feel funny.

Jerry:  If he does.

George:  Do you feel funny?  He didn't say anything.

Jerry:  He feels funny.  You don't have to do this.

George:  He knows that!

Jerry:  Roy, should we go?  Is this a breach of our friendship?

George:  Oh, can you be any more dramatic?

Roy:  Don't be ridiculous. (Notices George looking at a poster on the wall)
Holyfield.  He's a good friend of one of my patients.  He's got a hell of a
body, doesn't he?

George:  How would I know?

Roy:  Do you like him?

George:  What do you mean, like him?

Roy:  Do you like him?

George:  I mean he's a good fighter and a nice guy but I don't like him.

Roy:  How come you don't like him?

George:  Why should I?

Jerry:  What is the matter with you?

George:  Nothing, why?  You think something's wrong?  Am I different?

Roy:  So, you want the notes?

Jerry:  You don't have to, really.

Roy:  Nah nah, it's ok.

Jerry:  We should probably get one for Elaine, too, right George?  (turns to
George, who is staring intently at the Holyfield poster)  George?


New scene.
Jerry and Elaine are at Jerry's apartment, Jerry is on the phone.

Jerry:  Well what about the week after?  No appointments at all?  (Jerry tries
to sit down on the couch, but Elaine is too close to the end and he has to
squeeze in between her and the arm to sit down)  Can I at least just talk to her
so I can apologize?  Forget it.  (Hangs up)  I can't believe this, I make one
innocent comment about some lunatic in Pennsylvania and I'm cut off.  This woman
is insane.  (Looks at Elaine for a moment) What's with you?

Elaine:  What?

Jerry:  Well you were too close to me, I was all scrunched in there.

Elaine:  Hey, you scrunched me.  I sat down here first.

Kramer enters.

Kramer:  Hey, I saw DiMaggio in the donut shop again.

Jerry:  Uh huh.

Elaine:  Joe DiMaggio?

Kramer:  Joe DiMaggio, you know this time I went in and sat down across from him
and I really watched him.  I studied his every move.  For example, he dunks.

Elaine:  Joe DiMaggio dunks his donut?

Kramer:  That's right.

Jerry:  See, now I know it's not him.  Joe DiMaggio could not be a dunker.

Kramer:  Oh, he's a dunker.

Elaine:  Why couldn't he be a dunker?

Kramer:  And nothing diverts his attention.  Like, I'm uh, you know, like I'm
sitting in there, you know.  And I start banging on the table, you know, to uh,
look up, you know, Like I'm sitting there you know and uh, *bang* (slams the
table)  You know, *bang*  He wouldn't move.  So then I start doing these yelping
noises.  Like, *yip* (high pitched yelping noises) *yip*.  No reaction because
the guy is so focused, you see, he can just block out anything that's going on
around him.  See, that's how he played baseball.  He dunks like he hits.

Elaine:  So then what?

Kramer:  Well, then the waitress, she comes up and she tells me to shut up or
they're gonna throw me out.

Elaine:  Why didn't you just call out his name?

George enters, his pants are ripped at the knee.

Jerry:  What happened to you?

George:  One of those kids called me a Mary.

Elaine:  A what?


George:  I was jumping over a puddle and for some reason I went like this.
(George stretches out his arms in a ballet motion)  They called me a Mary.  So I
chased them, and I tripped and I fell.

Kramer:  Yeah, you know kids, they can be very perceptive.

Elaine:  Hey, George?  What is this? (Elaine makes the same outstretched arm
motion)  What is that?  No really, what is that?

George heads for the bathroom, the phone rings, Kramer answers it, Jerry grabs
it from him.

Jerry:  Hello?  Oh, hi Roy.  What?  Oh my god, how did this happen?  What can I
do?  Oh.  I am so sorry.  Okay.  Bye.  (Hangs up)  That was Roy.  He's under
investigation for insurance fraud.

Kramer (singing):  ...just a man and not a freak, Joltin' Joe DiMaggio.  Joe,
Joe.  Go, Joe...

Jerry:  I told you.

George:  Told me what?

Jerry:  I told you we shouldn't do it.

George:  He didn't say anything.

Jerry:  He's got a house, a family, they could take away his license.  You
should have heard him.  Three notes, how stupid was that?  We never should have
got three notes.

Elaine:  Three notes?

Jerry:  Yeah, you, me and George.

Elaine:  You got me a note?

Jerry:  Yeah.

Elaine:  But I got my own note.

Jerry:  You what?

Elaine:  I got a note from my gynecologist.

Jerry:  Why'd you do that?

Elaine:  I didn't know you were getting me a note.

Jerry:  Of course I was getting you a note.

Elaine:  But you didn't say anything.

Jerry:  Neither did you, that's how he got caught.  We sent in four notes from
two doctors.

Kramer:  How can you do that to your friend?  He's got a wife, kids, and a lot
of other stuff.  Oh, yeah.

Kramer leaves.


New scene.
Jerry and George are at Roy's office.

Jerry:  Hi Pam.

Pam:  Hello.

George:  Hello.

Jerry:  I just thought maybe I could talk to Roy.

Roy walks in.

Roy:  Pam, did the x-ray from Mrs. Sloan...  Hi.

Jerry:  Hi Roy.

George:  How ya doing?

Roy:  Come on back, I have a patient but she's under.


New scene.
Roy, Jerry and George are talking over a woman sleeping in a dental chair.

Jerry:  I don't even know what to say.

George:  Me neither.

Jerry:  I knew this would happen.

George:  Me too.

Jerry:  I mean the whole thing, it's just...

George:  Tragic.

Jerry:  Well it's not tragic.

George:  No?

Jerry:  No, it's...

George:  Unsettling?

Jerry:  Okay.  I mean, what if the--

Pam walks in and interrupts.

Pam:  I hope you're both happy.

Jerry:  I'm not happy.

George:  Me neither.  I've never been happy.

Jerry:  I mean I'm happy sometimes, but not now.

George:  In college, maybe.  Those were fun times.

Jerry:  Yeah, college was fun.

Pam walks in again and interjects.

Pam:  You know the whole practice is in jeopardy, you know that?

Roy:  Don't mind her.

Jerry:  Oh please, I love her.

George:  I've just met her but I'm very impressed.

Roy:  I can't understand, I've never had a problem with these notes before.

Jerry:  What's the next move, what's gonna happen now?

Roy:  Well, nothing really, as long as we get the physical therapist to go along
with our story.

Jerry:  What?  The physical therapist?  Why?

Roy:  She just has to say the complaint was related to a dental problem.

The woman in the chair wakes up and looks at Jerry and George.

George:  How ya doing?


New scene.
Jerry and George are at Julianna's office.

Jerry:  Hi.  Look, I know I don't have an appointment but it's really important
that I talk with Julianna.

Receptionist:  I'm sorry, Mr. Seinfeld, she's not it.

Jerry:  Yeah, I know she's mad at me but I really have to speak with her.

Receptionist:  I told you, she's not here.

Jerry:  You don't understand.

receptionist:  Look, you have to leave.

Jerry:  Wait a second, don't you--  (Julianna walks up with her child)  Hi.  Hi.
Look, I don't know what you--

Julianna:  Please!

Jerry:  --but, you see, let me just talk to you for a second, see, what I did is
inadvertently sent an insurance--

Julianna:  I treated you, so please, just get out of the office!

Jerry:  Can't you just listen to me?

Julianna (releasing her child):  Run Billy!  Run to the office and close the
door!  (to the receptionist)  Call the police!

Julianna then runs down the hall.

Jerry:  The police?

Raymond the masseuse walks up.

Raymond:  Hi George.

George:  Hello.

Jerry (to George):  Raymond?


New scene.
Elaine, Jerry and George are at the coffee shop.

Elaine:  Well, I mean it's only six months probation, it's a slap on the wrist.

Jerry:  Yeah, I still don't see any dinner invitations forthcoming.


George:  Men have been popping into my sexual fantasies.  All of a sudden, I'll
be in the middle.

Elaine:  Of what?  Oh.

George:  And a guy will appear from out of nowhere.  I say "Get out of here!
What do you want?  You don't belong here!"

Elaine:  What do they do?

George:  They talk back.  They go, "Hey George, how's it going?"  I say, "Get
the hell out of here!"

Jerry spots Kramer through the window.

Jerry:  Hey, it's the K-man. (he bangs on the glass to get Kramer's attention)
Maybe it's time you got as different hobby.

Kramer enters and sits at the booth.

Kramer:  I just came from Roy's.  I threw up from the gas.

The three all put down their coffee cups simultaneously.

Jerry:  Did he say anything?

Kramer:  No no, he's fine.

Jerry (noticing something across the coffee shop):  Oh my god, it's...

George (looking over):  Joe DiMaggio.

Kramer:  Where?

Jerry:  Having a cup of coffee.

Elaine:  He's dunking!

Jerry:  Wow.  Look at him.  The Yankee Clipper.  Here.

George:  You see?  Now that is a handsome man.  (Elaine and Jerry look right at
George)  Oh please.

Kramer:  Wait, wait.  *bang* (he slams his hand down on the table) *bang*
(again) *yip* (another high pitched yelping sound) *yip*  See?  I told you.


Closing monologue.

What causes homophobia?  What is it that makes a heterosexual man worry?  I
think it's because men know that deep down we have weak sales resistance.  We're
constantly buying shoes that hurt us, pants that don't fit right.  Men think,
"Obviously I can be talked into anything.  What if I accidentally wander into
some sort of homosexual store, thinking it's a shoe store, and the salesman
goes, 'Just hold this guy's hand, walk around the store a little bit, see how
you feel.  No obligation, no pressure, just try it.  Would you like to see him
in a sandal?'"

Welcome everyone to the room...Ah, the extra button....yeah ... what kind of a sicko

would save these ...have them in a huge file, drawers that wide (small fingers opening

imaginary drawers) Where the hell is that ... I mean is it THAT hard to get round black

buttons that they have to make it into such a great thing like this? ... is it such a

great jacket ... the buttons are so unique, so one of a kind, you'll never find them - they

save you the trouble of knocking your brain off - and we know they're going to fall off

too that's the other thing ...

JERRY: These are the receipts from 85 and I'm going to do 86.

Kramer: I'm sorry. I thought it was a legitimate charity. I didn't know you'd get audited

JERRY: I don't blame you. I blame myself.

KRAMER: No, blame me.

JERRY: OK, I blame you.

KRAMER: Don't blame me.

JERRY: What was I supposed to do? You knew I was on my first date with Elaine. You come

barging in here asking me to contribute money for a volcano relief fund for krakatoa.

KRAMER: It was supposed to erupt.

JERRY: I find the whole thing very embarrassing.

KRAMER: You know what my feelings are about this. I don't even pay taxes.

JERRY: Yeah, tha's easy when you have no income.

<Elaine enters>

ELAINE: Hi,

JERRY: Hi

ELAINE: Kramer, do me a favour will ya'. If you insist o making pasta in my

apartment please don't put the tomato sauce on the pasta while it's in the

strainer. All the little squares have hardened red sauce in them.

<Jerry smiles>

ELAINE: What's so funny

JERRY: Kramer dating your room mate. It's funny.

ELAINE: Uh, it's a riot Alice.

KRAMER: When do you pit the sauce on?

ELAINE: Any other time.

KRAMER: I like to strain the sauce.

ELAINE: And ... I could really live without the tribal music ... and the make out sessions

in the living room

KRAMER: Yeah, Tina likes the couch.

ELAINE: What are you doing? What is all this?

JERRY: Oh he's uh, helping me sort my receipts. I'm being audited.

ELAINE: O, your being auditted? What for?

JERRY: Oh, I contributed money to a charity that turned out to be fraudulent. It's very

boring.

ELAINE: When was this?

JERRY: Uh, Along long time ago, in a galaxy far far away.

ELAINE: I remember you donated to some volcano thing on our first date.

JERRY: Volcano? Really?

ELAINE: Oh, wait a minute. Don't tell me that that was ...

JERRY: Something to drink?

ELAINE: What did you think, that would impress me?

JERRY: You got it ALL wrong. I was thinking only of the poor Krakatoans

ELAINE: Like you this donation for 50 bucks and I'd start tearing my clothes off?

JERRY: Those brave Krakatoans East of Java. who sacrifice so much for so long.

ELAINE: Now you're being audited because of it. You see That's Karma.

JERRY: No, that's Krama.

ELAINE: So, waddya' going to do?

JERRY: It's all taken care of.

ELAINE: How is that?

KRAMER: <chuckles>

JERRY: An old friend of mine, whom you may have met, George Costanza,

has recently become intimate with a female accountant who was formally a highly

placed official with an outfit known as the IRS. And as we speak, at this very

moment he is handing over to her all of my pertinent tax information. And she

has assured us that the matter is well within her field of expertise.

ELAINE: Why is she doing this?

JERRY: I don't know. It must be love.

Monks

GEORGE: I don't think we should see each other anymore. You're great but I'm I'm riddled with

personal problems.

PATRICE: What did I do?

GEORGE: Nothing It's not you. It's me. I have a fear of commitment. I don't know how to love.

PATRICE: You hate my earrings don't you?

GEORGE: No, no,

PATRICE: And you didn't comment on the chop sticks.

GEORGE: I love the chop sticks. I, I personally prefer a fork but they look very nice.

PATRICE: You're not telling me the truth. I must have done something.

GEORGE: I have a fear of intimacy

PATRICE: Don't give me cliches. I have a right to know. What did I do wrong?

GEORGE: Nothing. It's not YOU..

PATRICE: I want the truth.

GEORGE: The truth. you want the truth? It is your earrings It is the chopsticks but it's so much

Papie-ay Mach-ay?

PATRICE: Keep goin'.

GEORGE: Can I uh, can I walk you back to work?

PATRICE: I prefer to go alone. How much do I owe?

GEORGE: Oh, please ... ... four dollars is f...

Jerry's Apartment

==================

JERRY: ... if this audit had happened to me and I didn't have this woman to help

me I would have killed this man. I would have strangled the life out of him

with my bare hands

ELAINE: I don't blame ya'

JERRY: Have you ever been through an audit?

ELAINE: No.

JERRY: It's hell. It's the financial equivalent of a complete rectal

examination. I would have killed this man. Torn him limb from limb, ripped the

flesh right off his bones ...

<buzzer>

JERRY: Yeah

GEORGE: George

JERRY: Come up - Ah, there he is, the man himself, George Louis Costanza. Here I am about to go

to the electric chair and my oldest friend is dating the governor

GEORGE: My whole life has been a complete waste of time, <chuckle>

JERRY: And there's so much more to go.

GEORGE: Now I know what I am supposed to do. It's so simple.

Tell the truth That's all. Just tell the truth

JERRY: So what happened? You gave her my tax papers? ... My papers?

GEORGE: Oh, oh, your papers

JERRY: What happened you didn't give her the papers?

GEORGE: No. I did.

JERRY: SO?

GEORGE: ...I broke up with her.

<Kramer leaves>

JERRY: You what?

GEORGE: I broke up with her.

JERRY: I'm being audited! And you broke up with her?

GEORGE: It's OK. It's fine. She'll do it. I'm sure she'll still do it.

JERRY: Why will she still do it? She hates you now. People don't do you favors after you dump

them.

GEORGE: Oh, no. We left on good terms.

JERRY: How is that possible?

GEORGE: Because I uh, I told her the truth.

JERRY: Oh, my God.

GEORGE: It's OK.

JERRY: It's unheard of ...

GEORGE: She asked me to.

JERRY: So you lie! What did you tell her?

GEORGE: I told her that she was pretentious.

JERRY: Pretentious!? The woman has my tax papers. You told her she was

pretentious? The IRS. They're like the MAFIA. They can take anything they

want

ELAINE: How would you like it if someone told YOU the truth?

GEORGE: Like what? What could they say?

ELAINE: There are plenty of things to say.

GEORGE: Like what? I'm bald? What is it specifically? Is, is there an odor I'm not aware of?

ELAINE: George, please.

GEORGE: Give me one.

ELAINE: You sure?

GEORGE: Yes.

ELAINE: What?

ELAINE: Forget it. You are very careful with money.

GEORGE: I'm cheap? You think I'm CHEAP? How could you say that to me? I can't

believe this. How could you say that to me?

ELAINE: You asked me to.

GEORGE: You should have lied.

ELAINE: HUH, so should you.

JERRY: OK, wait a second, wait a second, what happened to my papers?

GEORGE:<ignoring Jerry> I mean I'm not really working right now.

ELAINE: I know.

GEORGE: When I was working I spent baby.

JERRY: Yeah, I know champagne, limos, cigars. WHAT happened to the papers?

GEORGE: She put them in her pocketbook. I guess she took them with her.

ELAINE: Pocketbook or a handbag?

JERRY: Is that relevant? She TOOK them. Call her office.

GEORGE: Give me the phone. <dials> Yea, Hi I would like to speak to Patrice. ...

what? ... oh really? ... oh, ok, thank you, ... <hangs up>

JERRY: What? What?

GEORGE: She never came back from lunch.

JERRY: This is no good. This is no good. Call her house.

GEORGE: <dials> Hi, are you OK? no, no,.. huh, <hangs up> She hung up.

JERRY: Not good.

GEORGE: All right. There's nothing to be worried about. She's just a little

annoyed right now. Tomorrow I'll personally go over there. I'll apologize.

I'll get the papers. Don't worry. Don't worry. <exits>

JERRY: Not good

<break>

Jerry's Apartment

=================

KRAMER: Yeah, it's a windshield.

JERRY: I can see that. What's it for?

KRAMER: I found it on the road.

JERRY: Yeah (to buzzer)

ELAINE: (from intercom) I just finished working out are you busy?

JERRY: Come on up.

KRAMER: Can you believe somebody threw this out? You know I'm going to make a

coffee table out of this and surprise Tina.

JERRY: wouldn't it be invisible? I mean, what, are you going to just sense it's

in front of the couch?

KRAMER: wow

<Elaine enters - she and Kramer avoid each other's stares>

ELAINE: hell-oo

KRAMER: hell-oo

JERRY: What's with you two?

ELAINE: You haven't told him?

JERRY: Tell me what?

ELAINE: Huh, go ahead, tell him.

KRAMER: I, I saw her naked.

ELAINE: He saw me naked. Kramer, ... saw me naked.

KRAMER: Well, you know, ... it was an accident.

ELAINE: Who walks into a woman's bedroom without knocking. I want to know!

KRAMER: I thought it was a closet.

JERRY: Completely naked?

KRAMER: Completely naked.

ELAINE: Jerrryyy, How can I go on?

KRAMER: All right. I'll tell you what. If it's going to make you feel any better you can see me naked.

<Kramer begins disrobing>

ELAINE: No thanks!

KRAMER: No, I want you to see me naked.

ELAINE: No, no no.

KRAMER: No, I want to show you.

ELAINE: No! Jerry! Jerry!

JERRY: OK, just a second lets not lose our heads here. Kramer you know you are always welcome in my

home but as far as Mr. Johnson is concerned, that's another story.

<Kramer sits down picks up windshield>

ELAINE: Ehat is this?

KRAMER: Well, it's a windshield. It's going to be your new coffee table.

ELAINE: Ah, I'm going to kill myself on that thiing. You can't even see it.

JERRY: You'll sense it.

<George enters slowly>

JERRY: Well, what happened? Was she there?

GEORGE: No, no she wasn't.

JERRY: You didn't get my papers?

GEORGE: No, I didn't.

JERRY: Well, where is she?

GEORGE: A mental institution.

STAND UP ROUTINE

================

Why is it so difficult, uncomfortable, to be naked. It's because when you have

clothes on you can always kinda make those little adjustments that people like

to do ... you feel like you're getting it together, yeah, yeah pretty good

<pulling at lapels, pockets etc.> feeling good looking good But when you're

naked it's like it's so final you're, Well that's it. <no movements> There's

nothing else I can do. That's why I like to wear a belt when I'm naked. Cause I

feel it gives me something, I know I'm naked, but you know, <tugging and

lifting belt> I like to get pockets to hang off of the belt that would be,

wouldn't that be the ultimate? To be naked and still be able to do this <hand

in pocket> I think that would really help a lot.

================================================================

Jerry's Apartment

=================

JERRY: A mental institution?

KRAMER: You know what they do in there? Did you see CooCoo's Nest? They put those electrodes in

your head.

GEORGE: It's not really a mental institution. It's more like a depression

clinic. She went out to Woodhaven and checked herself in. I'm, I'm sick over

this.

ELAINE: Who told you this:

GEORGE: Her roommate. I've driven women to lesbianism before but never to a mental institution.

KRAMER: My friend Bob Sacamano had shock treatments. But his synapses were so large, it had no effect.

JERRY: You know I hate to raise a crass financial concern but was there any

information as to the where abouts of my PAPERS!

GEORGE: She put them in her pocket book. She probably took them out there with her.

JERRY: So what now?

GEORGE: I don't know.

JERRY: Can we go out there?

GEORGE: Where?

JERRY: Woodhaven.

GEORGE: We could.

Woodhaven

=========

GEORGE: I'm very nervous about this. I've never spoken to a mental patient before.

JERRY: My cousin Douglas was in a place like this one time . He came over to

my house for dinner. There was no soda and he went bezerk. He was screamin'

"where's the Pepsi, where's the Pepsi?"

GEORGE: I should be in a place like this I envy this woman. Ya' get to wear

slippers all day. Friends visit. They pity you. Pity is very underrated. I

like it it's good. Plus they give you those word association

tests. I love those.

JERRY: That'd be great. There's no wrong answer.

GEORGE: Potato

JERRY: Tuberculosis

GEORGE: Blanket

JERRY: Leroy

GEORGE: Grass

JERRY: Tuberculosis

GEORGE: Oh, boy. Here she comes.

Elaine's Apartment

==================

<African music is playing as Elaine enters, dirty pots and dishes are piled high in the kitchen>

ELAINE: Oh, my god.

<Kramer enters dancing with only a towel on.>

ELAINE: KRAMER!

KRAMER: Hey.

ELAINE: WILL YOU PLEASE PUT SOMETHING ON.

KRAMER: Uh, you want some leftovers? I made some African food. There's, yambalas and uh, sambusa.

TINA: Kramer, are you coming back to bed?

KRAMER: Yeah, yeah, I'll be right there baby.

TINA: Oh, hi Elaine. <returns Elaine's ear rings> What did you think of the coffee table?

ELAINE: It's invisible.

KRAMER: So, is everything cool? or what?

TINA: Yeah, you seem little bit dysfunctional.

ELAINE: Well,

TINA: Come on Elaine. just tell us the truth.

ELAINE: The Truth!, You want The Truth?

Woodhaven

=========

PATRICE: Who are you?

GEORGE: Oh, this is my friend Jerry.

PATRICE: Why are you talking like that? And what do YOU want?

JERRY: Want, want? What could I possibly want? Uh, I just came because I, I heard so many nice things

about you from George.

PATRICE: George thinks I'm pretentious.

GEORGE: Pretentious? Who isn't pretentious? Ha, ha, if everyone who was

pretentious was in a mental institution, ... uh, obviously THIS isn't a mental

institution.

PATRICE: You're just trying to take it all back because you're feeling guilty I'm in here.

GEORGE: No, that's not it at all.

PATRICE: Don't LIE George.

GEORGE:I'M NOT A LIER!

GEORGE: Uh, we're cool. Everything's cool (to security attendent)

JERRY: Just chatting. Friendly.

GEORGE: All righty, no reason for us to uh, raise our voices.

PATRICE: I know what you said. You can't change that.

GEORGE: What I said? I saw stupid things all the time I can't go two minutes without saying stupid things.

JERRY: It's one stupid thing after another. So let me ask you, when you come to one of these places,

what do you bring your pocketbook?

GEORGE: You should be the one criticizing me. I, I'm lucky to even know someone like you.

PATRICE: You mean that?

GEORGE: Of course I mean that. I am incapable of guile.

JERRY: He's never guiled. You know some women keep a lot of important papers in their, uh, pocket book.

Like for example oh, someone else's personal financial papers.

PATRICE: Papers? Oh, Jerry, You're the Jerome with the tax problem. You know after that day with George I

got so cuckoo I threw out all your papers. So I'd love to help you but I'll need the copies.

JERRY: there are no copies.

PATRICE: So are you saying you want to continue seeing me?

JERRY: Who makes copies?

Elaine's Apartment

==================

ELAINE: The truth is ... I think you make ... a very nice couple.

<Elaine exits>

KRAMER: Oh,

TINA: Kramer,

<dancing in the dark to the music>

TINA: Here Kramer?

KRAMER: No, lets go to the couch...

<sound of smashing glass>

Jerry's Apartment

================[

JERRY: <on phone>Yes, I'm trying to get a copy of a receipt for a computer thatI bought there....

it was 1987 ... I remember I talked to a guy - he had like a maroon sport jacket - and he might

have had a toupee - oh, it was a weave - ok uh, then I'll come bye ok, bye.

JERRY: Anybody want to take a walk down to 48th street? I think I may have tracked down another receipt.

ELAINE: I can't. I have to go visit Tina in the hospital.

JERRY: George?

GEORGE: I'm going to a poetry reading with PATRICE: First time poets, in a burnt out building, down by the docks,

Supposed to be good.

<Kramer enter - all bandaged up.

KRAMER: Hey, Are you going to the hospital now?

ELAINE: Yeah, I suppose I am.

KRAMER: All right, great, great uh, we'll share a cab.

JERRY: You're going by 48th St. You can give me a ride.

GEORGE: Hey, I'm getting in on that.

ELAINE: You know you're chippin' in.

GEORGE: You're going that way anyway!

Stand Up

=========

I was audited last year. At first I thought well, IRS kinda sounds like Toys R

Us maybe won't be so bad. Maybe they have a sense of fun about it, you know.

But it's it's bad. It's an ordeal. And they don't do anything to keep your

spirits up through the ordeal. I think they should take all your receipts and

put them in one of those big Lucite sweepstake and just kinda crank it around

there. You know give me a feeling like you might win something. You know what I

mean? Then they can pull them out one by one and go "Oh, I'm sorry that's

another illegal deduction. But we do have some lovely parting gifts for you.

Jail!"



THE END


[Setting: Night club]

JERRY: I have never seen an old person in a new bathing suit in my life. I don't know where they get their bathing suits, but my father has bathing suits from other centuries. My parents live in Florida, and if you go down there and you forget your bathing suits then they want you to wear one of theirs. You know how that gets? "You need trunks son? I've got trunks for you. You can wear my trunks." Fathers don't wear bathing suits, they wear trunks. It's kind of the same thing a tree would wear if it went swimming. So I get in the water with in thing and it's like floating around me somewhere. Did you ever put on a bathing suit that you don't even know exactly where you are inside the bathing suit? You bump into somebody you know: "No I'm parasailing, I'm waiting for the boat to come back."





[Setting: Florida, evening, condo of Jerry's parents]

HELEN: (looking by the window) They were supposed to be here at 7:30. Call the airlines again.

MORTY: (searching in a kitchen drawer) What happened to the scotch tape? Who takes the scotch tape? Nobody returns anything around here.

HELEN: Oh I think that's them!

MORTY: You what I'll do next time? I'll hide it so nobody can find it.

(Jerry and Elaine enter)

ALL: Hi, welcome, greetings, hugs, etc.

MORTY: Welcome to Florida!

ELAINE: Hi Mr. Seinfeld! (hug)

JERRY: Hey, there's the old man! (hug)

MORTY: So, what took you so long?

JERRY: We waited 35 minutes in the rent-a-car place.

HELEN: I don't know why you had to rent a car. We would have picked you up.

JERRY: What's the difference?

HELEN: You could have used our car.

JERRY: I don't wanna use your car.

HELEN: What's wrong with our car?

JERRY: Nothing. It's a fine car. What if you wanna use it?

HELEN: We don't use it.

MORTY: What are you talking? We use it.

HELEN: If you were using it, we wouldn't use it.

JERRY: So what would you do? You'd hitch?

HELEN: How much is a rent-a-car?

JERRY: I don't know. 25 bucks a day.

HELEN: What? You're crazy.

MORTY: Plus the insurance.

JERRY: Oh, I didn't get the insurance.

MORTY: How could you not get the insurance?

HELEN: We'll pay for the car.

JERRY: You're not paying for it.

HELEN: Morty. (asking him to back her. He doesn't)

JERRY: God it's so hot in here. Why don't you put on the air conditioning?

HELEN: You don't need the air conditioner. So, you have your speech all ready?

JERRY: It's not a speech. Do I have to make a speech?

HELEN: Of course, they're giving a testimonial for your father. You could do your comic routines.

JERRY: (ironically) Oh yeah, that will go over real well with that crowd.

ELAINE: (looking by the window) Ooh, you have a lake?

JERRY: The lake isn't real.

HELEN: The lake is real.

MORTY: Are you kidding? They built the lake.

HELEN: But it's real. It's water.

(Jerry and Elaine take their luggages to the guest room)

HELEN: Where are you going with those?

JERRY: I'm gonna put Elaine's stuff in here.

HELEN: Don't sleep in there. You can you use the bedroom.

ELAINE: I can't take your bedroom.

HELEN: I'm up at 6 o'clock in the morning.

ELAINE: I can't kick you out of your bed.

HELEN: We don't even sleep.

JERRY: Ma.

HELEN: But this is sofa bed, you'll be uncomfortable.

JERRY: (to Morty) What about you?

MORTY: Why should I be comfortable?

JERRY: (to Helen) What about him?

HELEN: Don't worry, he's comfortable.

MORTY: I'll sleep standing up. I'll be fine.

HELEN: Will you stop?

ELAINE: Yeah, I'll just stay in here. (goes in the guest room)

HELEN: (asking Jerry to go in the kitchen so Elaine won't hear) Jerry. You don't have to stay on the couch on my account. The two of you could stay in there together.

JERRY: No that's not such a good idea.

HELEN: Well I tought that...

JERRY: Not now. She's right inside.

HELEN: (quieter) What happened?

JERRY: I don't know. We decided we don't really work as a couple.

HELEN: What does that mean?

JERRY: Well...

MORTY: (comes to the kitchen and with a loud voice) Why are you whispering?

JERRY: Shh! Nothing, nothing.

HELEN: Elaine...

MORTY: (still loud) What about her?

JERRY: (tries to explain to Morty but Elaine then comes out of the guest room to get more luggages, so he fakes a conversation) ...but you know, look at the sun-dried tomatoes. Where were they five years ago? It just goes to show you. You never know what... huh (waiting for Elaine to go back in the guest room) you know... huh... What could happen to a vegetable. It could just take right off at any time. (Morty finally gets it. So Jerry goes on quieter) We've tried all kind of arrangments, but we can't seem to be friend when we sleep together.

MORTY: (Morty goes on louder! Did he ever whisper in any episode? :-) Why do you need more friends? You've got plenty of friends.

HELEN: He's an idealist.

MORTY: What the hell are you looking for?

JERRY: I'm looking. That's the point. I like looking.

HELEN: He likes looking.

MORTY: So look.

HELEN: But how long can you look?

JERRY: I'm going for the record.

(Morty walks away with a face like he disagrees with Jerry)

HELEN: You know your father wouldn't say so but he's really glad you came.

JERRY: Oh, come on.

HELEN: This is a big thing for him. Outgoing president of the condo association.

(knock on door: this is Jack and Doris, neigboors)

MORTY: Aha!

DORIS: So they arrived safely.

MORTY: (to Jerry) You remember Jack and Doris?

JERRY: Nice to meet you. This is Elaine.

ELAINE: Hi. Nice to meet you.

JACK: So Jerry, you came all the way down here for this?

ELAINE: And scuba diving.

HELEN: Scuba diving? Who's going scuba diving?

JERRY: We're going scuba diving. We'll be back in time.

HELEN: What do you have to go scuba diving for?

JERRY: For fun.

HELEN: For fun?

MORTY: Jack have some spong cake.

JACK: No. thanks, no.

MORTY: Jack is emceeing tomorrow. He's in charge of the whole thing.

JACK: So Jerry, your mother told me you're gonna do one your little comedy skit tommsorow?

JERRY: I don't think so.

JACK: No? Listen Morty you wanna settle up for last night? (Morty nods) All right. I owe you 19.45$ (he gets his checks book and a pen from his pocket).

MORTY: What did you have? You had the minute steak?

JACK: Yeah.

MORTY: Did you have a coke or what?

JACK: I did NOT have a coke.

MORTY: Somebody had a coke.

HELEN: Oh I had a coke.

DORIS: And I had the scampi.

JACK: So that's 17.10$ and the tax and the tip.

MORTY: All right. Make it 20 bucks.

JACK: It's: 19.45$, Morty. (he gives him the check)

MORTY: 19.45$ ?

JACK: See? You know your father. He can't get a write to the penny, but that's why he was such a good president.

(Jerry notices Klompus's pen)

JERRY: What kind of pen is that?

JACK: This pen?

JERRY: Yeah.

JACK: This is an astronaut pen. It writes upside down. They use this in space.

JERRY: Wow! That's the astronaut pen. I heard about that. Where did you get it?

JACK: Oh it was a gift.

JERRY: Cause sometimes I write in bed and I have to turn and lean on my elbow to make the pen works.

JACK: Take the pen.

JERRY: Oh no.

JACK: Go ahead.

JERRY: I couldn't

JACK: Come on, take the pen!

JERRY: I can't take it.

JACK: Do me a personal favor!

JERRY: No, I'm not...

JACK: Take the pen!

JERRY: I cannot take it!

JACK: Take the pen!

JERRY: Are you sure?

JACK: Positive! Take the pen!

JERRY: O.K. Thank you very much. Thank you. Gee, boy!

HELEN: Jack, what are you doing?

JACK: Stop it!

DORIS: Jack, we should go. (they go to the door) It was nice to meeting you.

ELAINE: Mmm, nice to meet you.

JERRY: Thanks again.

JACK: Come on!

DORIS: (to Morty) She's adorable. (they leave)

HELEN: (as soon as the door's closed) What did you take his pen for?

JERRY: What he gave it to me.

HELEN: You didn't have to take it.

MORTY: Oh my God! She's gotta make a big deal out of everything.

JERRY: He offered it to me.

HELEN: Because you made such a big fuss about it.

JERRY: I liked it. Should I have said I didn't like it?

HELEN: You shouldn't have said anything. What did you expect him to do? (the camera shows Elaine shaking her head at their dispute)

JERRY: He could have said: "Thank you, I like it too" and put it back in his pocket.

HELEN: He loves that pen.

MORTY: Oh come on!

HELEN: He talks about it all the time. Every time he takes it out he goes on and on about how it writes upside down, how the astronauts use it.

JERRY: If he likes it so much, he never should have offered it.

HELEN: He didn't think you'd accpet.

JERRY: Well, he was wrong.

HELEN: I know his wife. She has some mouth on her. She'll tell everyone in the condo now that you made him give you the pen. They're talking about it right now. (againe we see Elaine smiling at their argument)

JERRY: So you want me to return it?

HELEN: Yes.

MORTY: He's not gonna return the pen. That's ridiculous.

JERRY: Hey I don't even want the pen now!

MORTY: Jack can afford to give away a pen with all his money. Believe me. He gives me a check for 19.45. He didn't have a Coke. Ho, ho, ho!

ELAINE: Here, let me see it. (She takes a pad to try the pen) Hey, it wrtites upside down.

(scene ends)





[setting: condo's guest room]

(Elaine is lying on the sofa bed. It's too hot. She can't fall asleep)

(knock on door)

ELAINE: Come in.

JERRY: Are you O.K. in here?

ELAINE: Why is it so hot in here? How can they sleep like this?

JERRY: It's only for three days. Today's over and we have tommorow. We leave on Sunday. It's one day, really.

ELAINE: Oh man. What is with this bar? It's right in my back. It's killing me.

JERRY: Oh you wanna switch? I'm sleeping on a love seat. I've got my feet up in the air like I'm in a space capsule.

ELAINE: I am never gonna fall asleep.

JERRY: Oh, don't say that. You'll jinx me.

ELAINE: How can they not put the air conditioning on?

JERRY: They're nuts with temperature.

ELAINE: This bar is right in my back! It's making a dent.

JERRY: How about that guy writing a check for 19.45?

ELAINE: I'm sweating here. I'm in bed, sweating.

JERRY: It's one day. Half a day, really. I mean you substract showers and meals, it's like twenty minutes. It will go by like that. (snapping his fingers)

(scene ends)





[setting: condo, morning]

(Jerry and Morty are sitting at the table, Helen is at the counter. Elaine's still sleeping? Well, she's still in the guest room.)

MORTY: Stay on 95 South to Biscayne Boulevard. Then you make a left turn. Put you blinker on immediatly, there's an abutment there. Then you're gonna merge over very quickly, but stay on Biscayne. Don't get off Biscayne. You understand me?

JERRY: Stay on Biscayne.

HELEN: You're going underwater?

JERRY: Yes. Generally that's where scuba diving is done.

HELEN: What do you have to go underwater for? What's down there that's so special?

JERRY: What's so special up here?

(Elaine open the guest room's door and she's in pain)

ELAINE: Oh!

(everybody get up and walk to her)

HELEN: What's the matter?

ELAINE: My back.

HELEN: What happened?

ELAINE: That... That bed. The bar was right in my back.

HELEN: (to Jerry) I told you to let us sleep in there.

JERRY: Then YOU would be hunched over.

ELAINE: I don't even know if I can go scuba diving.

JERRY: You can't go?

HELEN: So stay home.

ELAINE: You can go.

JERRY: Without you? That's the whole reason you came down here.

HELEN: Don't go.

JERRY: You sure?

MORTY: Maybe you should see a doctor.

JERRY: We'll stay in a hotel tonight.

ELAINE: (whispering to Jerry) Yes!

HELEN: No, we'll stay in there.

JERRY: Why don't you get a new sofa?

MORTY: Nobody uses it.

JERRY: I'm buying you a new sofa.

HELEN: Oh Jerry, don't talk crazy.

ELAINE: Mrs Seinfeld, please. I am begging you. Put the air conditioner on.

HELEN: You're hot?

ELAINE: I've lost 6 pounds.

HELEN: I don't even know how to work it.

MORTY: I keep telling her it's like an oven in here.

(Evelyn, a neighboor, enters)

EVELYN: Is everybody up?

JERRY: Hi. How are you?

EVELYN: Hello Jerry.

JERRY: Evelyn, this is Elaine.

ELAINE: (with pain) Hi Evelyn.

EVELYN: Jerry you got thin.

JERRY: Too thin?

HELEN: Oh stop worrying so much about how you look.

EVELYN: So where's the new pen? (everybody's surprised by this question)

JERRY: (Jerry scratches his head and acts like he's not sure what she's talking about) What?

EVELYN: The pen. The one Jack Klompus gave you.

HELEN: How did you know that?

EVELYN: Blanche told me.

HELEN: Blanche?

EVELYN: That's some good pen. It writes upside down.

ELAINE: The astronauts use them.

HELEN: What did Blanche say?

EVELYN: I don't know. She said Jerry wanted the pen.

JERRY: I never really wanted the pen.

MORTY: He gave him the pen.

HELEN: Morty.

EVELYN: Why you don't like the pen?

JERRY: No, no, I...

EVELYN: Cause if you don't like it, give it back to him.

HELEN: Is that what she said?

EVELYN: Who?

HELEN: Blanche.

EVELYN: What are you talking about?

(The phone rings, Helen answers.)

HELEN: Hello? Oh hello Gussy. What? Jerry wouldn't do that. Jack gave it to him. All he said was he liked it. I mean nobody put a gun to his head. (to Jerry) You're giving him back that pen. (She continues the discussion with Gussy but we don't hear it.)

ELAINE: Somebody please-- THE AIR CONDITIONER!

MORTY: (Morty gets up) Oh! I forgot all about it.

(the phone conversation is over. Helen looks at Jerry.)

JERRY: All I said was "I like the pen".

(Morty looks at the control panel for the air conditioner)

MORTY: How the hell do you work this thing?

(scene ends)





[setting: still the condo, later]

(Jerry's gone scuba diving. Elaine is lying on the floor with pillows under her legs. Morty and Helen are on the couch, looking at Elaine. Helen is wearing a sweater and she's freezing)

HELEN: Maybe you shouldn't go tonight.

ELAINE: No no, I wanna go.

HELEN: But your back hurts.

MORTY: Maybe a couple of muscle relaxers would help.

ELAINE: Oh, oh, O.K. (Helen holds her sweater tight against herself) You can turn down the air conditioning if you want.

HELEN: No. I'm fine.

ELAINE: You're not too cold?

HELEN: No.

(Jerry enters with a black eye)

JERRY: Don't be alarmed.

MORTY: Oh my God! What the hell happened to you?

JERRY: I'm O.K. My capillaries burst.

HELEN: Your capillaries? Do you know what you look like?

JERRY: (to Elaine on the floor) How are you doing?

ELAINE: Having a good time!

JERRY: Is it my imagination or is it freezing in here?

HELEN: What happened to your eyes?

JERRY: Well I started to go under...

HELEN: With the instructor?

JERRY: Yeah, and I got about ten feet down and I felt this tremendous pressure on my mask. Like my eyeballs were being sucked out of their sockets.

HELEN: I told you...

(Jack enters, all dressed-up, smoking a cigar)

JACK: Excuse me. (to Helen) Doris would like to borrow red your pocketbook to go with her shoes. (to Elaine on the floor) The shoes have to match the pocketbook. (to the others) What's she doing? Yoga?

ELAINE: My back hurts.

JACK: Morty you gotta hurry up. Get ready.

MORTY: We got plenty of time.

JACK: (to Jerry) What happened to you?

JERRY: I got in a fist fight with one of the ladies at the pool.

HELEN: It's from scuba diving.

JACK: What's there to see underwater?

(Helen turns to Jerry and makes a face like: give him back the pen)

JERRY: Listen M. Klompus, it was really a nice gesture of you to give me the pen, but I don't really need it.

JACK: You what?

JERRY: I mean it's a terrific pen, but I think you should keep it. (he tends the pen to Jack)

JACK: Well I mean...

JERRY: Take it.

JACK: All right! (he smiles and take it)

(Morty gets up and walks right to Jack)

MORTY: You know Jack, you've got a hell of a nerve taking that kid's pen.

JACK: Whose pen?

MORTY: His pen.

JACK: This happens to be my pen.

MORTY: You didn't give it to him.

JACK: What are you talking about? He pratically begged me for it.

MORTY: Where do you come off with this crap?

JACK: Listen, do you think I take everything everybody offers me? You offered me sponge cake yesterday. Did I take it?

MORTY: You said you didn't want it!

JACK: Of course I wanted it! I love sponge cake!

MORTY: Then who the hell said you couldn't have any? I mean what the hell do I care whether you have sponge cake?

(Jerry and Elaine can't beleive what they're hearing)

JACK: Because I saw the look on your face last week when I took the scotch tape!

MORTY: Ahh! Ahh! So YOU got the scotch tape! I've been looking all over for it!

JACK: Don't worry about it! I'll give it back!

MORTY: I don't want it!

JACK: I don't want it!

MORTY: You know Jack, do me a favor will you? Take the pen and the scotch tape, and get the hell out of here!

JACK: Listen do you think I give a damn?

MORTY: Aah! (Jack leaves) The nerve of that guy! Taking back that pen. Well that'it for them.

JERRY: What is going on in this community! Are you people aware of what's happening? What is driving you to this behavior? Is it the humudity? Is it the Muzak? Is it the white shoes?

HELEN: I have no use for either one of them. I don't even want them there tonight. (she still has the pocketbook in her hands)

JERRY: Isn't he supposed to be the emcee?

MORTY: yeah, he's supposed to be the emcee.

JERRY: Well. This should be a very interesting evening.

ELAINE: (still on the floor) Uh... What about those muscle relaxers?

(scene ends)





[setting: reception room, evening]

(Morty, Helen, Elaine and Jerry are standing for a photograph in the entrance. Jerry wears sunglasses and Elaine is all drugged-up on muscle relaxers.)

PHOTOGRAPHER: Say astronaut.

(Elaine is laughing for nothing and she walks right up to the lens of the camera.)

ELAINE: Say what? (laughing) Say what?

JERRY: (Jerry brings her back) You took too many of those pills.

MORTY: Astronaut?

HELEN: Say it.

JERRY, MORTY AND HELEN: Astronaut!

ELAINE: (still laughing, she says it just as the picture is taking) Astro...naut!

(the image frozes and we see that the picture is awful, with Jerry and his sunglasses, and Elaine laughing who can barely stand.)

MORTY: Good. O.K. (the photographer walks away) What about last year when I took him to the hospital every day? Did he ever say thank you?

JERRY: Oh God. (foreseeing an arm's grabbing as he sees Uncle Leo entering with his wife Stella)

JERRY: (to Leo) Uncle Leo.

LEO: Hello!

STELLA: Morty are you nervous?

MORTY: What nervous?

LEO: (to Jerry while he's grabbing his arm as usual) What's with the sunglasses? Who are you? Van Johnson?

JERRY: I've got a black eye.

STELLA: (to Elaine in a childish voice) Hello.

JERRY: Elaine, this is my aunt Stella.

HELEN: (shouting as she imitates Marlon Brando) STELLA! STELLA!

JERRY: (to Stella) Her back hurts.

STELLA: Humm... We saw you on "The Tonight Show" last week.

LEO: I thought Johnny was very rude to you. He didn't even let you talk.

JERRY: No, no.

LEO: You need some new material. I've heard you do that dog routine three times already.

ELAINE: (still with her imitation, shouting even louder) STELLA! STELLA!

LEO: Listen, you should get your cousin Jeffrey to write some material for you.

MORTY: What are you talking? Jeffrey works for the parks department!

LEO: You should read the letters he's written. He's funnier than the whole bunch of you! (Jack enters with Doris) Oh, here's Jack. We should sit down.

(Jack and Morty exchange a look.)

STELLA: (to Helen on a sarcastic tone of voice) This better be good. I'm missing "Golden Girls" for this.

HELEN: (laughing hypocritically till Stella walks away) I hate her like poison.

(a few minutes later, the ceremony is about to begin. Someone in the crowd yells: "Jack let's get started!" Everyone applause and we see, from left to right, all sitting on the same side of a long table, facing the public: Stella, Leo, Elaine, Jerry, Helen, Morty, Jack at the microphone, Doris, and four other people.)

JACK: (on the microphone) Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, every year, Phase Two of the Pines of Mark Gables honors the previous year president. And this year we are honoring Morty Seinfeld (the crowd applause and someone yells: Morty!) A man who slept more hours on the job than Ronald Reagan.

MORTY: (to Helen) Slept on the job? (she shushed him)

JACK: Being president of the condo is not easy. It requires hard work, dedication, and commitment, and unfortunately he possesses none of these qualities. (everyone laugh except Jerry, Helen, and Morty. Even Elaine who's still druggy)

HELEN: (Morty complains again to Helen) He's joking.

JACK: His administration did excel in one department: the hiring of incompetents.

MORTY: (to Jack, loud) That's what you say.

JACK: But we do owe him a debt of gratitude because by not fixing the crack in the sidewalk, he put Mrs Ziven out of commission for a few weeks. (Morty is now the only one not laughing)

MORTY: (loud) Tell them when you took my son's pen back. Tell them about that! (he gets up)

JERRY: Dad!

MORTY: (to the crowd) He gave my son a pen, and then he takes it back. Tell them about that!

JACK: He gave it to me!

MORTY: Come on. That's enough, sit down!

JACK: I'm not sitting down!

(they start to fight. Morty tries to get the microphone off Jack' hands. He yells to Jack to give him the pen. Jerry gets up and tries to separate them. We hear a feedback from the microphone and they stop to fight)

JACK: Ow! You broke my dental plate! (Jack is touching his dental plate while Morty reaches in Jack's pocket to get the pen) Doris! He broke my dental plate. You son-of-a-bitch! I'm gonna sue you. (he leaves the table and Morty follows him and continue arguing with him. Jerry now have the microphone in his hands and the crowd begins to think the ceremony is over.)

HELEN: Jerry, do your act.

JERRY: (in the microphone, but to Helen) I can't. Nobody's even listening.

HELEN: They're all gonna leave.

JERRY: (to himself) Oh God! (in the microphone) huh... Hey! How you folks doing tonight? (everybody in the crowd is talking over Jerry)

MAN IN THE CROWD: Who are you?

JERRY: (still with his sunglasses) Have you ever noticed how they always give you the peanuts on the planes?

WOMAN IN THE CROWD: (to heckle Jerry) Not my Harry. He flies first class.

(Elaine is almost asleep at the table)

JERRY: Who ever thought the first thing somebody wants on a plane is a peanut?

MAN IN THE CROWD: I'd rather have a bottle of scotch!

HELEN: (to Jerry) Do the dog routine.

JERRY: All I said was I liked the pen!

ELAINE: (wakes up and yells very loud) STELLA!

(Everybody stops talking and put their hands on their ears)

(scene ends)





[setting: condo, morning]

(Elaine is sitting on the couch and a chiro is examining her. Jerry's sitting next to her. Helen is standing beside them and Morty is still asleep in the guest room)

CHIROPRACTOR: You could aggravated. I wouldn't go anywhere for at least five days.

ELAINE: Five days? You want me to stay here for five more days?

JERRY: There must be some mistake.

CHIROPRACTOR: I'm afraid not.

ELAINE: (discouraged) Five days. Here.

HELEN: (to Jerry, happily) So we have you for five more days!

JERRY: (to Elaine) Well there's really no point in me staying. I mean you just gonna be...

ELAINE: Excuse me?

JERRY: Nothing.

(Evelyn enters)

EVELYN: Good morning.

JERRY: Hi Evelyn.

EVELYN: (to Helen) Has Morty decided on a lawyer yet?

HELEN: I don't think so.

EVELYN: Because my nephew Larry could do it. He's a brilliant lawyer. He says Jack has no case.

HELEN: I'll ask him when he gets up.

EVELYN: Oh, and I spoke to Arnold. And he says that according to the bylaws of the condo constitution, they need six votes to throw you out for unruly behavior. Not five. Doctor Chernov is the one you'll have to suck up to.

(Morty gets up in a bad shape)

MORTY: Aw! Aw! Oh my back! Oh my back! It's that bar. Who the hell could sleep on that thing?

HELEN: I was very comfortable.

EVELYN: Morty, Arnold says they need six votes to throw you out.

HELEN: It's in the constitution.

MORTY: (to the chiro) Who are you?

CHIROPRACTOR: I'm a chiropractor.

MORTY: What are you kidding me?

ELAINE: (to Jerry) Five more days?

JERRY: Well today's almost over. And weekdays always go by fast. Friday we're leaving. It's like two days really. It's like a cup of coffee. It will go by like that. (snapping his fingers)

(scene ends)

[setting: night club, closing monologue]

Is Florida not hot and muggy enough for these people? They love heat. I mean if they ever decide to land men on the sun, I think these old retired guys would be the only ones that will be able to handle it. They'll just sit there on the sun, on the redwood benches, washcloth on the head going: "Close the door, you're letting all the heat off the sun. I'm trying to get a sweat going."

(end of the show)


Opening monologue.

So I'm on the plane, we left late. Pilot says we're going to be making up some
time in the air. I thought, well isn't that interesting. We'll just make up
time. That's why you have to reset your watch when you land. Of course, when
they say they're making up time, obviously they're increasing the speed of the
aircraft. Now, my question is if you can go faster, why don't you just go as
fast as you can all the time? C'mon, there's no cops up here, nail it. Give it
some gas! We're flying!
New scene. Jerry is on an airplane, seated beside a talkative (and inebriated)
man.

Gavin: Travelling, of course, is the best education. Do you know last year I
was in over forty, forty-five countries, and I would have gone to more but I had
just got a puppy, and he was too young to take with me. But now I won't travel
without him.

Jerry: Is he on the plane now?

Gavin: Oh yes. Yes, he's in the, he's in the baggage compartment. I don't
know why they won't let him sit up here with me. He's a lot better behaved than
most of the dregs you find onboard here. Do you, do you have any pets?

Jerry: Uh, just my next door neighbor.

Gavin: You're missing out on a relationship that could enrich your life in ways
that you never could have thought possible.

Jerry: Howbout picking up their, you know. You find that enriching?

Gavin leans back in his seat wearing a pained expression.

Jerry: What's the matter?

Gavin: Oh, I'm feeling a bit queasy.
Cut to external shot of the plane in flight, then back into the cabin where
flight attendants are tending to Gavin, who is lying on the floor.
Attendant #1: Sir, we're gonna make an emergency landing in Chicago and get you
to a hospital.

Gavin: My dog. What about my dog?

Attendant #1: Uh, you have a dog?

Attendant #2: Do you know anyone on the plane, Mr. Palone?

Jerry stares out the window.

Gavin: Jerry?

Jerry: Huh? How you feeling?

Gavin: Would you take care of Farfel?

Jerry: Farfel?

Attendant #2: It's his dog. We're landing in Chicago to get him to a hospital,
could you take his dog to New York?

Jerry: The dog? The dog??

Gavin: I'm sure it's only for a day or two.

Jerry: But, you know, what if, you know?

Gavin: Give me your address and phone number, I'll call you.

Jerry: The dog?
New scene. Jerry's apartment, he's got all of his furniture up and there's a
loud incessant barking coming from the bedroom. Jerry and Farfel are playing
'tug of war' with one of Jerry's sneakers. Elaine is in the kitchen.

Jerry: Let go, Farfel! Let go, gimme that! Gimme the sneaker you stupid
idiot! Shut up! (to Elaine) So what would you do?

Elaine: Well it's only been three days, I'm sure he's gonna call.

Jerry (to Farfel): STOP IT! SHUT UUUUUUP!!! (to Elaine) Do you believe this?
Do you believe what I'm dealing with here, I've got a wild animal in the house!
He's deranged, maybe he's got rabies. I can get lockjaw.

Elaine: If only.

Jerry: Look at this place. He's going everywhere, I can't go out of the house
at night. I haven't performed in three days. This'll be my first night out of
the house since I got back.

Elaine: Hey, when you walk him, do ya...

Jerry: Do I what?

Elaine: Do you pick it up?

Jerry: Yes, I pick it up.

Elaine: You pick it up?!?

Jerry: Well you have to.

Elaine: Oh, boy would I love to see that.

Jerry: SHUT UP!! Shut up Farfel, stop it! (to Elaine) I don't know what to
do. I mean what if I take it to the pound then the guy shows up?

Elaine: Maybe you should call the airline, they might know where he is.

Jerry: No, I tried. they don't know anything. (notices Elaine making egg
creams) You gotta put the syrup in first.

Elaine: No, milk.

Jerry: I'm telling you the guy's a drunk, he's probably on a bender.

Elaine: What is a bender anyhow?

Jerry: I don't know, they drink and they bend things at the bar.

Elaine: I can't believe he hasn't called.

Jerry: Two hundred seats on a plane, I gotta wind up next to Yukon Jack and his
dog Cujo. Shut up! One more day and you are pound bound!

Kramer enters.

Kramer: Sorry, I can't watch the dog tonight.

Jerry: Why?

Elaine: We're going to the movies, we're gonna see Prognosis Negative.

Kramer: I can't, I gotta get this Ellen out of my life.

Jerry: You're breaking up?

Kramer: Oh ho ho ho yeah, the sooner the better. I can't wait to do it. You
know how there's some people you worry about whether you're going to hurt their
feelings? With her, I'm looking forward to it. I'd like to get it on video,
watch it in slow motion and freeze frame it. Oh ho, yeah.

Elaine: Kramer, I don't know how you lasted as long as you did.

Kramer: Woah, you didn't like her?

Elaine: If you could see her personality it would be like one of the Elephant
Man exhibits, you know where they pull off the sheet and everyone gasps.

Jerry: I can't believe someone hasn't killed her yet.

Kramer: How come you never said anything?

Jerry: You can't tell someone how you feel about their girlfriend until after
they stop seeing them.

Kramer: I tell you.

Jerry: You. I'm talking about people.

Elaine: Are we still going to the movies tonight?

Jerry: No, I can't I gotta watch Farfel, you and George can go without me.

Elaine: Just me and George?

Jerry: Sure.

Elaine: But we need you.

Jerry: What do you need me for?

Jerry's buzzer buzzes.

Elaine: Because... Yeah?

George: Prognosis Negative!

Elaine buzzes George into the building.

Elaine: Because I relate to George through you, we're like friends-in-law.
Besides, you said we were gonna see Prognosis Negative together. Can't you just
put some newspapers down or something?

Jerry: No, I can't trust him, he gets insane. I won't enjoy myself. That's
right, Farfel, I'm talking about you!

Elaine: Just me and George alone?

George enters.

George: Let's go, people, let's go! It's Prognosis Negative time, wa ha ha
ha!!!

Jerry: I can't go.

George: Can't go, Why not?

Jerry: Because I have to watch idiot Farfel.

George: I thought Kramer was watching.

Jerry: He's breaking up with his girlfriend tonight.

George: Well so what's the problem, you just put some newspaper down.

Jerry: No, I don't want that smell in the house.

George: You spritz a little Lysol on it.

Jerry: No, it's like BO and cologne, they combine forces into some kind of
strange mutant funk.

George: So we're not going?

Jerry: Nah. You two go.

George: Oh. You still wanna go?

Elaine: Do you?

George: If you want.

Elaine: It's up to you.

Jerry: Go ahead.

Elaine: Well, it's, I really wanted to see Prognosis Negative with Jerry, uh,
you wanna see Ponce de Leon?

George: Ponce de Leon? Okay. (to Jerry) You sure you don't wanna go?

Jerry: I want to but I can't.

Elaine: Oh! I tell you what. How about if I come back here first and I clean
everything up and I open up the windows and if you're still not satisfied we can
switch apartments for the night.

Jerry: No.

George: What about this--

Jerry: Forget it. Go ahead, you'll have a good time.

Elaine: I know, it's not that.

George: It's just we want you to go.

Jerry: Well, thank you very much. I'm telling you, one more day stinkbreath!
On my block, a lot of people walk their dogs, and I always see them walking
along with their little poop bags, which to me is just the lowest function of
human life. If aliens are watching this through telescopes, they're gonna think
the dogs are the leaders. If you see two life forms, one of them's making a
poop, the other one's carrying it for him, who would you assume was in charge?
New scene.
George and Elaine are at the coffee shop after seeing Ponce De Leon. They're
obviously uncomfortable alone together.

George: So how long did you live there?

Elaine: About three years.

George: That's pretty long.

Elaine: Hmm.

George: It's not that long, really.

Elaine: Yeah. An uncomfortable silence ensues. They both speak at the same
time, then stop. Another silence.

George: And then you came here.

Elaine: Yeah. So I've been here about six years.

George (Counting on his fingers): Eighty-six, eighty-seven, eighty-eight,
eighty-nine, ninety, ninety-one... Yup.
New scene.
Jerry vs. Farfel, part II

Jerry: Bad dog! Bad dog! You go outside! Outside!! What do you want from
me? Tell me! Money, you want money? I'll give you money, how much?!
New scene.
Kramer is breaking up with his girlfriend.

Kramer: I must have been out of my mind. Look at you. Why don't you do
something with your life? Sit around here all day, you contribute nothing to
society. You're just taking up space. How could I be with someone like you?
Couldn't respect myself.



New scene.
Monk's, Elaine and George are as bored as before.

George: I like herbal tea.

Elaine yawns.

George: Chamomile's good. Lemon Lift. Almond Pleasure.

Elaine: Jerry likes Morning Thunder.

George: Jerry drinks Morning Thunder?

Elaine: Yeah.

George: Morning Thunder has caffeine in it, Jerry doesn't drink caffeine.

Elaine: Jerry doesn't know Morning Thunder has caffeine in it.

George: You don't tell him?

Elaine (laughing): No. And you should see him, man, he gets all hyper, he
doesn't even know why, he loves it! He walks around, going, "God, I feel
great!"

George (laughing): You don't tell him?

Elaine: No.

George: That is so funny!

Elaine: I know!

George: Wait, have you ever seen him throw up?!

They both make the same convulsive gestures together and break out in more
laughter.
New scene.
Kramer has had a change of heart.

Kramer: Please! Please!! I take it all back, everything! I take it all back,
every word! I love you! I love *you*! I can't live without you, I'll do
anything!
New scene.
Jerry's at his apartment, on the phone, Farfel is barking.

Jerry: That's right, Gavin Palone. What? Are you sure? He was released on
Monday? *Last* Monday? Did he leave a phone number or address? Unbelievable.
Well thank you, thanks, thanks very much. (Hangs up) That's it, Farfel!
Party's over! Start packing up your little squeeze toys buddy boy, you're
checking out!
New scene.
Jerry and Elaine are cleaning Jerry's apartment.

Elaine: It was weird because George and I get along so great in so many
situations but this is the first time we ever really went one-on-one.

Jerry: Oh, one-on-one's a whole different game. Can't pass off.

Elaine: The only time it wasn't uncomfortable was when we were making fun of
you.

Jerry (answering phone) Hello? Aha! Boy George, about time. Beautiful, how
soon? Okay, here's the plan. We take the dog to the pound, we go right to the
movies. Right, you, me and Elaine. Yes, all three of us. I am going. Okay,
see you in five minutes.

Jerry hangs up the phone and begins singing and dancing.

Jerry: Going to the dog pound, everybody! Going to the dog pound, come on
down. (To Elaine) What?

Elaine: Do you have to?

Jerry: What am I supposed to do? I don't want to do it. I like dogs. I'm not
sure this is a dog.

Elaine: You know, the guy might have just lost your number.

Jerry: I'm in the book and I have a machine.

Elaine: Jerry, do you know what they do to dogs at the pound? They keep them
there for a week and then if nobody claims them, they kill them.

Jerry: Really? How late are they open?

Kramer enters.

Jerry: What?

Elaine: What is it?

Kramer: I went back with Ellen.

Jerry and Elaine: Ohhhhh, that's great.

Elaine: Terrific.

Jerry: Yeah, I really think you guys are good together.

Elaine: Yes, she understands you and she is not demanding.

Kramer: Do you think that I forgot what you two said about her?

Jerry: I was just trying to be supportive, you know. I knew you were upset.

Kramer: From now on when we pass each other in the hall, I don't know you, you
don't know me.

Elaine: Oh, Kramer, we didn't mean it.

Jerry: What are you doing?

Kramer: I'm getting my pot.

Kramer grabs a put from under the counter and walks out.

Elaine: Kramer, we like her.

Jerry: Kramer? What did we say that's so bad?

Elaine: I believe I referred to her personality as a potential science exhibit.

Jerry: I said, "How come no one's killed her?" Probably shouldn't have said
anything, everyone knows the first break-up never takes. (answers buzzer)
Yeah?

George: Prognosis Negative!

Farfel begins barking.

Jerry: Okay, Farfel, put your shoes on.

Elaine: Jerry, can't you just give it one more day, it's not his fault.

Jerry: It's not my dog, I don't know where this boozehound is.

Elaine: Alright, I tell you what. How about if you and George go to the
movies, and I stay here and watch the dog tonight.

Jerry: I can't let you do that, what about Prognosis Negative?

Elaine: We'll see it Sunday.

George enters.

George: Tonight's the night, right? Prognosis Negative?

Elaine: I'm not going, I'm gonna watch the dog.

George: What does this mean?

Jerry: Well, we'll go see something else tonight. We'll see, uh, Ponce De
Leon.

George: What is with this dog, I thought we were taking it to the pound.

Jerry: She talked me into one more day. Talk amongst yourselves, I'm gonna go
to the bathroom.

George: Uh Jerry, how long will you be in there?

Jerry: I don't know, regular human time?

George: Uh why don't you wait then go in the movies?

Jerry: Why shouldn't I go here?

Elaine: Well, you know, I mean, sometimes it's good to get there and make sure
you get your seats and then go to the bathroom.

George: And isn't it more fun using the urinal?

Elaine: Yeah.

Jerry: Oh yeah, urinals are fun. Can I go?!

George: Hey, go.

Elaine: Who's stopping you?

George: What, are you doing me a favor?

Elaine: Like we care if you go to the bathroom.

Elaine and George, left alone together are obviously uncomfortable.

George: How's it going?

Elaine: Good. Good. You?

George: Things are good.

After a pause, George starts whistling, then picks a chew toy off the floor and
squeezes it towards Elaine, making a squeaking sound.

Elaine: Boy, he takes such a long time.

George: I know.

Elaine: You know what he does in there? He gargles.

George: Jerry gargles? Is that why he takes so long?

Elaine: Yeah, he does it like six times a day.

George: How come we never hear him?

Elaine: Because he does it quiet. He does it quiet. Lookit, Just like this,
watch.

Elaine gargles some water and they both break out in laughter.

George: Wait, wait, did you ever see him throw up?!

Elaine: We talked about that already.

George: Oh.
New scene.
Jerry and George are in line outside the Cine 66 theater.

George: I have nothing to say to anybody. I'm so uninteresting. I think I'm
out of conversation.

Jerry: So what are calling me six times a day?

George: All I know about is sports. That's it. No matter how depressed I get,
I could always read the sports section.

Jerry: I could read the sports section if my hair was on fire.

George: Know what? Ponce De Leon is sold out.

Jerry: It is? Oh yeah, you're right. What else is playing?

George: Nothing except Prognosis Negative.

Jerry: Boy, I know she really wants to see that with me.
New scene.
Elaine and Farfel are playing 'tug of war' with a jacket.

Elaine: Gimme the jacket, furface, this is not Seinfeld you're dealing with!
When I get through with you, you'll be begging to go to the pound!

The phone rings, Farfel begins barking.

Elaine: Shut up. Shut up! (Answers phone) Hello? No, who's calling? Oh my
god, the dog guy. Where have *you* been? Yeah, well you better pick up your
dog tonight or he has humped his last leg.

Cut back to Jerry and George.

George: I mean, I could understand if there was something else playing, but
it's this or nothing.

Jerry: I don't know what to do.

George: What is this 'saving movies' thing? Something's playing, you go.

Jerry: I know, I know.

George: So, what? We're gonna do nothing now, this is crazy.

Jerry: It is kind of silly.

George: Of course it is.

Jerry: I mean, it's just a movie, for god's sake.

George: Exactly.

Jerry: It's not like she's *in* the movie.

George: Right.

Jerry: Am I supposed to ruin the whole night because she wants to see it? I
mean, if I could have seen it with her, fine. But I can't control all these
circumstances and schedules and peoples' availabilities at movies.

George: And she'll still see it, you're not stopping her from seeing it.

Jerry: How does sitting next to a person in a movie theater increase the level
of enjoyment? You can't talk during a movie. You know, this is stupid, c'mon,
let's just go.

George: Good.

Jerry: Saving movies.

George: Ridiculous!

Jerry: Two for Prognosis Negative. I'm in trouble.

George: Oh, you're dead.
New scene. Jerry's apartment, Gavin has come to collect his dog. Farfel is
barking as loud as ever.

Gavin: Bell's Palsy. The entire side of my, of, of my face was paralyzed.
Farfel! I couldn't, I couldn't, I couldn't even feed myself, I was completely
incapacitated. Quiet Farfel!

Jerry: You know it's interesting, because I called the hospital and they said
you were released on Monday.

Gavin: Yes, yes, that's true, but then I was taken to the Bell's Palsy Center
in, in, in, in Rockford. Absolutely first rate facility, top notch physicians.

Kramer: Hey, c'mon, c'mon, get off me!

Gavin: He won't hurt you, he's just playing.

Kramer: Hey you keep that mutt away from me.

Gavin: Mutt? I'll wager his parents are more pure than yours.

Ellen: Kramer, are you coming?

Jerry: Oh, hi Ellen.

Ellen: Get in here.

Kramer sulks off.

Jerry: Listen, it's really been a pleasure taking care of your dog for a week,
but if you don't mind...

Gavin: Pre-prediction. You'll be calling me to ask if you can come and visit
him before the month is out.

Jerry: Prediction. I never see you or him again for the rest of my life.

Farfel barks very loudly and pulls Gavin into the hallway and out of Jerry's
apartment.
New scene.
Jerry and Elaine at in Jerry's apartment.

Elaine: We made plans.

Jerry: Why don't we just rent a movie?

Elaine: I thought you wanted to see Prognosis Negative.

Jerry: No, it's supposed to be really bad, *really* bad. I mean it's long,
there's no story, it's so unbelievably boring, I heard.

Elaine: Jerry, you promised me we'd go.

Jerry: Well, George told me the whole story, line for line, I mean I almost
feel like I've seen it already and walked out on it.

Elaine: Wait, George saw the movie? I saw him yesterday, he didn't mention it.

Jerry: You and George got together?

Elaine: Yeah, I wanted to talk about how we have nothing to talk about.

Kramer enters.

Jerry: Hello.

Kramer, Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi.

Jerry: What's up?

Kramer: Well, you were right.

Jerry: About what?

Kramer: Ellen. We, uh, broke up again.

Jerry and Elaine, together: Awwwwww.

Jerry: Too bad.

Elaine: I thought she was the one.

Kramer: I'll bring back the pot.

Elaine: Okay, c'mon it's movie time.

Kramer: Hey, what are you gonna see?

Jerry: Prognosis Negative.

Kramer: Hey, that's supposed to be great.

Jerry: It's not.

Kramer: How do you know?

Jerry: I have an instinct for these things.
Closing monologue.

I had a parakeet when I was a kid, that was the only pet that I really enjoyed.
We used to let him out of his cage, and he would fly around and my mother had
built, one entire wall of our living room was mirrored. She felt this gives you
a feeling of space. Have you ever heard this interior design principle that a
mirror makes it seem like you have an entire other room? What kind of a jerk
walks up to a mirror and goes, "Hey look, there's a whole nother room in there.
There's a guy in there looks just like me." But the parakeet will fall for
this, you'll let him out of his cage, he flies around the room, BANG! With his
little head, he would just go 'click' Ohh! And I'd always think, even if he
thinks the mirror is another room, why doesn't he at least try to avoid hitting
the other parakeet?


JERRY'S APARTMENT

JERRY: Let me speak with the head librarian. ... Because it's absurd. An overdue book

from 1971? ... This is a joke right? What are you? From a radio station?

KRAMER: enters

JERRY: Ya' got me I fell for it. Alright, OK I can be down there in like a half hour.

Bye.

KRAMER: What's the problem?

JERRY: This you're not goin' to believe. The NYPL says that I took out Tropic of Cancer

in 1971 and never returned it.

KRAMER: Do you know how much that comes to? That's a nickel a day for 20 years. It's

going to be $50,000

JERRY: It doesn't work like that.

KRAMER: If it's a dime a day it could be $100,000

JERRY: It's not going to be anything. I returned the book. I remember it very vividly

because I was with Sherry Becker. She waore this orange dress. It was the first time I

ever saw her in a dress like that. In oticed since ninth grade she was developing this

body in secret under these loose clothes for like two years. And then one day ...

FLASHBACK <to a beautiful buxom young Becky in an orange dress>

JERRY: That orange dress is burned in my memory

KRAMER: Oh, memory burn.

JERRY: I wonder what ever happened to her.

KRAMER: How did they ever find you?

JERRY: Oh, computers, they're cracking down now on overdue books. The whole thing is

completely ridiculous.

<buzzer>

JERRY: It's George. Wait 'til he hears we're going to the library

KRAMER: You know I never got a library card.

JERRY: <to speaker> Coming down.

KRAMER: It's all a bunch of cheapskates in there anyway. People sitting around reading

the newspaper attached to huge wooden sticks Trying to save a quarter, ooh,

JERRY: I gotta go to the library. You want to go?

KRAMER: Yeah,

LIBRARY

KRAMER: The Dewey Decimal System, what a scam that was. Boy that Dewey guy really cleaned

up on that deal.

JERRY: Where's George

READER: Shhh.

KRAMER: Tryin' to save a quarter.

JERRY: I kinda like those sticks. I'd like to get them for my house.

TURNING TO LIBRARY COUNTER

JERRY: This woman's completely ignoring me.

KRAMER: Look at her. This is a lonely woman looking for companionship.. ... Spinster. ...

Maybe a virgin. ... Maybe she got hurt a long time ago. She was a schoolgirl. There was

a boy It didn't work out. Now she needs a little tenderness. She needs a little understanding.

She needs a little Kramer.

JERRY: Eventually a little shot of penicillin

LIBRARIAN: Yes?

JERRY: Yes I called before. I got his notice in the mail.

LIBRARIAN: Oh, Tropic of Cancer, Henry Miller, Uh, this case has been turned over to our

library investigation officer Mr. Bookman.

KRAMER: Bookman? The library investigator's name is actually, Bookman?

LIBRARIAN: It's true.

KRAMER: That's amazing. That's like an ice cream man named, Cone.

LIBRARIAN: Lt. Bookman has been working here for 25 years so I think he's heard all the jokes.

JERRY: Can I speak with this Bookman?

LIBRARIAN: Just a second.

GEORGE ENTERS, FRANTICALLY, TUGS AT JERRY'S JACKET

GEORGE: Jerry,

JERRY: What?

GEORGE: I think I saw him. I think it's him.

JERRY: Who?

GEORGE: Did you see the homeless guy on the library steps screaming obsenities and doing some

calesthetics routine

JERRY: Yeah.

KRAMER: yeah

GEORGE: I think that's Mr. Hayman. ...The gym teacher from our High School.

READER: Shhh.

JERRY: <whispers> Are you sure?

GEORGE: He's older, completely covered in filth, no whistle, but I think it's him.

JERRY: George got him fired. He squealed on him.

KRAMER: Ooh tattle tale

GEORGE: <yells> I didn't tattle

READER: Shh Shh

KRAMER: What did this guy do? What happened?

GEORGE: There was an incident. I'd rather not discuss it.

KRAMER: Oh come on, You can tell me.

GEORGE: Some other time.

KRAMER: What tonight?

LIBRARIAN WALKS BY

KRAMER: Y'know I never figured you for a squealer.

JERRY: Oh, he sang like a canary.

LIBRARIAN: Mr. Bookman's not here.

JERRY: Not here? Why was I told to come down here?

LIBRARIAN: He'll be out all afternoon on a case.

KRAMER: He's out on a case? He actually goes out on cases?

JERRY: Well what am I supposed to do now?

LIBRARIAN: I'll have Mr. Bookman get in touch with you.

JERRY: All right Thanks. Come on lets go

GEORGE: Let's see if it's Hayman?

KRAMER: Hey, uh, I'll see you boys later. <TURNS TO LIBRARIAN> So uh, what's a guy got to do

around here

to get a library card?

PENDANT PUBLISHING OFFICES

ELAINE: Where's Karen?

SECRETARY: She went to pick up lunch.

ELAINE: She didn't ask me what I wanted.

SECRETARY: She must have forgot.

ELAINE: How could she forget I've been ordering lunch every day here for 3 and a half years?

Is there something you're not telling me because I'm getting a really weird vibe.

Is Lippman getting rid of me? It's OK I won't say anything.

SECRETARY: I don't know anything.

ELAINE: Ah, you don't know anything. You see, "I don't know anything", means there's

something to know. If you really didn't know anything you would have said "You're crazy."

LIPPMAN ENTERS

ELAINE: Oh, hi Mr. Lippman.

LIPPMAN: Elaine,

ELAINE: Um, uh, I was wondering if you got a chance to look at that , um, biography of

Columbus, I gave you?

LIPPMAN: Yes I did. Yes I did. ... Maureen this water is still too cold.

ELAINE: It's freezing. ... Hurts your teeth.

AT MONKS

ELAINE: I'm tellin' ya' somethin' is goin' on. He never likes anything I recommend.

And then that lunch thing.

JERRY: So they forgot to get your lunch. Big deal!

ELAINE: What do you know. You've never worked in an office. <TURNS TO GEORGE> See,

you've worked in an office. Jerry thinks I'm over reacting but you understand, ... LUNCH!

GEORGE: I don't understand lunch, I don't know anything about lunch. Listen. Just because

I got the guy fired doesn't mean I turned him into a bum - does it?

ELAINE: What did he do?

GEORGE: He purposely mispronounced my name. Instead of saying, "Costanza" He'd say,

"Can't stand ja".

"Can't stand ja" ... He made me smell my own gym socks once.

JERRY: I remember he made you wear a jock on your head for a whole class. And the straps

were hangin' down by his ,...

GEORGE: OK, OK, I never even had him for gym.

JERRY: I had him for Hygene. Remember his teeth. It was like from an exhumed corpse.

GEORGE: Little baked beans

JERRY: Echh

ELAINE: Come on tell me what happened.

GEORGE: Well, OK. As I said the guy had it in for me. He actually failed me in gym.

... ME!

FLASHBACK TO HIGH SCHOOL LOCKER ROOM

GEORGE: ... Those spastic shnitzer twins ...

HEYMAN: Can't stand ja ... Can't stand ja

GEORGE: Yes, Mr. Hayman

HEYMAN: Your underwear was stick'n out of your shorts during gym class.

GEORGE: Well I guess that's because I wear boxer shorts.

HEYMAN: Boxer shorts, ha? Well what brand?

GEORGE: I'm not really sure, I...

HEYMAN: Well let's take a look.

<GEORGE: gets a wedgie>



BACK TO MONK'S

GEORGE: He gave me a wedgie.

JERRY: He got fired the next day.

ELAINE: Why do they call it a wedgie?

GEORGE: Because the underwear is pulled up from the back and ... it wedges in..

JERRY: They also have an atomic wedgie. Now the goal there is to actually get the

waistband on top of the head. Very rare.

ELAINE: Boys are sick.

JERRY: Well what do girls do ?

ELAINE: We just tease some one 'til they develop an eating disorder.

guy who ruined his life.

KRAMER ENTERS

KRAMER: Hey Babaloo, you better get home. You know this guy Bookman from the library

he's waiting for ya.

===========================================================================

STANDUP ROUTINE

What's amazing to me about the library is it's a place where you go in you can take

out any book you whant they just give it to you and say bring it back when you're done.

It reminds me of like this pathetic friend that everbody had when they were a little

kid who would let you borrow any of his stuff if you would just be his friend. That's

what the library is. A government funded pathetic friend. And that's why everybody

kinds of bullies the library. I'll bring it back on time ... I'll bring it back late.

... Oh, what are you going to do? Charge me a nickel?

===========================================================================

JERRY'S APARTMENT

JERRY: Oh, I'm glad you're here, so we can get this all straightened out. Would

you like a cup of tea?

BOOKMAN: You got any coffee?

JERRY: Coffee?

BOOKMAN: Yeah. Coffee.

JERRY: No, I don't drink coffee.

BOOKMAN: Yeah, you don't drink coffee? How about instant coffee?

JERRY: No, I don't have--

BOOKMAN: You don't have any instant coffee?

JERRY: Well, I don't normally--

BOOKMAN: Who doesn't have instant coffee?

JERRY: I don't.

BOOKMAN: You buy a jar of Folger's Crystals, you put it in the cupboard, you

forget about it. Then later on when you need it, it's there. It lasts

forever. It's freeze-dried. Freeze-dried Crystals.

JERRY: Really? I'll have to remember that.

BOOKMAN: You took this book out in 1971.

JERRY: Yes, and I returned it in 1971.

BOOKMAN: Yeah, '71. That was my first year on the job. Bad year for libraries.

Bad year for America. Hippies burning library cards, Abby Hoffman

telling everybody to steal books. I don't judge a man by the length of

his hair or the kind of music he listens to. Rock was never my bag. But

you put on a pair of shoes when you walk into the New York Public

Library, fella.

JERRY: Look, Mr. Bookman. I--I returned that book. I remember it very

specifically.

BOOKMAN: You're a comedian, you make people laugh.

JERRY: I try.

BOOKMAN: You think this is all a big joke, don't you?

JERRY: No, I don't.

BOOKMAN: I saw you on T.V. once; I remembered your name--from my list. I looked

it up. Sure enough, it checked out. You think because you're a celebrity

that somehow the law doesn't apply to you, that you're above the law?

JERRY: Certainly not.

BOOKMAN: Well, let me tell you something, funny boy. Y'know that little stamp,

the one that says "New York Public Library"? Well that may not mean

anything to you, but that means a lot to me. One whole hell of a lot.

Sure, go ahead, laugh if you want to. I've seen your type before:

Flashy, making the scene, flaunting convention. Yeah, I know what you're

thinking. What's this guy making such a big stink about old library

books? Well, let me give you a hint, junior. Maybe we can live without

libraries, people like you and me. Maybe. Sure, we're too old to change

the world, but what about that kid, sitting down, opening a book, right

now, in a branch at the local library and finding drawings of pee-pees

and wee-wees on the Cat in the Hat and the Five Chinese Brothers?

Doesn't HE deserve better? Look. If you think this is about overdue

fines and missing books, you'd better think again. This is about that

kid's right to read a book without getting his mind warped! Or: maybe

that turns you on, Seinfeld; maybe that's how y'get your kicks. You and

your good-time buddies. Well I got a flash for ya, joy-boy: Party time

is over. Y'got seven days, Seinfeld. That is one week!

<Marion sneaks into Kramer's apartment behind Bookman's back as he opens Jerry's

door to leave>

KRAMER'S APARTMENT

KRAMER: What's wrong?

MARION: It's Bookman the library cop.

KRAMER: So I didn't do anything wrong.

MARION: I'm supposed to be atwork. I could get fired. I shouldn't have come here.

KRAMER: Why don't ya' leave?

MARION: I can't.

JERRY'S DOORWAY

JERRY: No way I'm payin' that! I returned that book I n 1971. I have a witness

Sherry Becker. She wore an orange dress. She gave me a piece of black jack gum.

It's a licorice gum. What do ya' think of next I remember it.

<thinks out loud, opens phone book> Becker, ... Becker, ...



IN MONKS WITH SHERRY

SH: Kevin went to a public school, he's the 14 year old? We were gonna' send Marsha

to a private school. Cause in some way they don't learn ... enough ... I think.

JERRY: So Sherry, what do you remember about that day at the library?

SH: I remember it like it was yesterday. It was a Friday afternoon. I wore a purple dress.

JERRY: Purple? Ya' sure it wasn't orange?

SH: Positive. And I was chewin' Dentyne. I always chewed dentyne. Remember Jerry? Dentyne?

JERRY: No Black Jack?

SH: Licorice gum? Never! We were reading pasages to each other from that Henry Miller book,

JERRY: Tropic of Cancer.

SH: No, Tropic of Capricorn

JERRY: Tropic of Capricorn?

SH: Rememba? What holds the world togetha' ... "As I have learned from bitter experience

is sexual intercourse ."

JERRY: Wait a second. Wait a second. You're right. I had both of them.

We read from TROPIC OF CAPRICORN. I was all set to return TROPIC OF CANCER. And then ...

FLASHBACK TO LOCKER ROOM

JERRY: Here's the book. Don't let anybody see it. Don't let anything happen to it.

GEORGE: Jerry, it's me, George, don't worry, I'll return it

JERRY: Ok, I'll see you after school. I.m late for Hayman's hygiene.

BACK TO MONKS

SH: Where ya' going?

JERRY: It was nice seeing you again. I just remembered something. I've got to go.

<to old man that enters>

It was GEORGE!

LIBRARY

KRAMER: Read another poem.

MARION: Pressed chest fleshed out west Might be the saviour or a garden pest.

KRAMER: Wow, that is great. You should be published.

KRAMER: You know, the library is kind of a cool place when it's closed.

MARIAN: Oh, yeah. You don't have to be quiet. Listen to the echo: HELLO!

KRAMER: HELLO!

MARIAN: HELLO!

KRAMER: HELLO!

MARIAN: HELLO!

BOOKMAN (emerging): Hello!

MARIAN (turning, surprised): Mr. Bookman.

BOOKMAN: I remember when the librarian was a much older woman: Kindly,

discreet, unattractive. We didn't know anything about her private life.

We didn't want to know anything about her private life. She didn't have

a private life. While you're thinking about that, think about this: The

library closes at five o'clock, no exceptions. This is your final

warning. Got that, kewpie-doll?



JERRY'S APARTMENT

<Jerry in bedroom>

ELAINE: Lippman want's to see me in his office SEE ME! That can't be good

JERRY: Maybe you're getting' a raise.

<buzzer>

ELAINE: Maybe I'm getting' a wedgie.

ELAINE: What?

GEORGE: It's George

ELAINE: George is on his way up.

JERRY: Wait 'til I tell him about the book.

KRAMER: <reading> sobs

ELAINE: Are you OK? What? What?

KRAMER: It's marion's poetry. I can't take it <leaves sobbing>

ELAINE: Remember that biography I recommended? MY BOSS HATED IT

<Jerry enters>.

JERRY: I'm right here.

ELAINE: Remember that Columbus book?

JERRY: Columbus, Euro trash.

<George enters>

GEORGE: Well, it's definetly him.

ELAINE: Him? Him who?

GEORGE: Him who? Hayman him.

ELAINE: Hayman The gym teacher? You found him?

GEORGE: Oh, I found him. He was sitting on the steps of the library. I sat down

next to him. He smelled like the locker room after that game against Erasmus

JERRY: That was double overtime.

GEORGE: So I said, "Mr. Hayman, It's me george Costanza, JFK, ... " He doesn't move.

So I said uh, "Can't stand ya'", "Can't stand ya'" He turns and smiles, the little

baked bean teeth. I get up to run away, but something was holding me back. It was

Heyman. He had my underwear. There I was on the steps of the 42nd St. library ,

a grown man, getting a wedgie.

ELAINE: At least it wasn't atomic.

GEORGE: It was.

JERRY: So Georgie Boy, guess what happened to TROPIC OF CANCER

GEORGE: How should I know?

JERRY: Because I gave it to you.

GEORGE: Me?

JERRY: Yesah, think. Don't you remember you kept begging me to see it then finally

I agreed. You were supposed to return it. I met you in the gym locker room.



GEORGE: The locker room!

THE LOCKER ROOM

JERRY: Here's the book. Don't let anybody see it. Don't let anything happen to it.

GEORGE: Jerry, it's me, George, don't worry, I'll return it tomorrow, no problem.

JERRY: All right, I'll see you after school. I.m late for Hayman's hygiene.

HEYMAN: Can't Stand Ya'.

GEORGE: Yes Mr. Hayman.

HEYMAN: Your underwear was stick'n out of your shorts during gym class.

GEORGE: Well I guess that's because I wear boxer shorts.

HEYMAN: Boxer shorts, ha? Well what brand?

GEORGE: I'm not really sure, I...

HEYMAN: Well let's take a look.

<George gets a wedgie and TROPIC OF CANCER falls on floor>

LIBRARY

< Jerry writes out a check for the never-returned TROPIC OF CANCER and hands it to Bookman>

JERRY: Anyway, I hope there's no hard feelings.

BOOKMAN: Hard feelings? What do you know about hard feelings? Y'ever have a man

die in your arms? Y'ever kill somebody?

JERRY: What is your problem?

BOOKMAN: What's my problem? Punks like you, that's my problem. And you better not

screw up again Seinfeld, because if you do, I'll be all over you like a

pitbull on a poodle.

JERRY: (after Bookman exits): That is one tough monkey! <turns to Elaine>

So you were saying?

ELAINE: Oh? So, I took your suggestion and I gave my boss Marion's poems.

The ones that affected Kramer so much.

JERRY: Oh, beautiful did he like them?

ELAINE: No, ... he didn't! No, ... he didn't!

JERRY: <to George> Was he out there?

GEORGE: Na, he's gone. I wonder what happened to him.

JERRY: I guess we'll never know.

SOME BACK ALLEY

HEYMAN: Can't stand ya, <laughing> Can't stand ya. <pan to TROPIC OF CANCER on ground>

========================================================================================

STAND UP

It was a weird school day, you know what I mean because it kind of like started of kind

of normal. You have like English, Geometry, Social Studies and then suddenly you're like

in Lord of The Flies for 40 minutes you know you're hangin' from a rope. You have hardly

any clothes on. Teachers are yellin' at ya' "Where's your jock strap?" Ya' know and kids

are throwin' dodge balls at you. You're tryin' to survive ... Then its History,

Science, Language. There's something off in the entire flow of that day.

==============================================================================================

- THE END -

[Opening monologue.]

There's always that one location, one store location that's constantly changing hands. Everybody has this in their neighborhood, it's a leather store, it's a yogurt shop, it's a pet supply. It's constantly changing and nobody can do business there. It's like some sort of Bermuda triangle of retail, you know? Stores open up and then they just disappear without a trace. Nobody knows what happened to 'em. I guess eventually when like aliens land in mother ship of close encounters, bottom will slowly open and all these store owners will come wondering out in a daze going 'I thought there would be more walk-in traffic didn't you?.'


[George and Jerry are standing outside in the street. Across the street there is a restaurant called Dream Cafe. Sign says Grand opening.]

George: She thinks I'm a nice guy. Women always think I'm nice, but women don't like nice.

Jerry: This is amazing, I haven't seen one guy going in to that restaurant since it opened. Poor guy.

George: Why is nice bad? What kind of sick society we are living in, when nice is bad?

Jerry: What's that smell? What are you wearing?

George: Little cologne.

Jerry: Manly.

George: Monica wants me to wear it.

Jerry: So why didn't you say no?

George: I'm too nice.

Jerry: Poor guy. His family is probably in Pakistan waiting him to send back money. This is horrible.

George: She wants me to take an IQ test.

Jerry: That's because you're stupid enough to wear the cologne.

George: No, she's taking this course in education for her masters. It's part of her research project, I have to be a guinea pig.

Jerry: I've never been a guinea pig. I've been a sheep, a tody.

George: You know, I can't talk to you anymore.

Jerry: All right, I'm sorry. Go ahead, you're taking the IQ test.

George: Yeah, and she's going to find I'm a moron. You know, people think I'm smart, but I'm not smart.

Jerry: Who thinks you're smart?

George: I'm not going to break a hundred in this thing.

Jerry: What thing?

George: You don't listen when people talk to you anymore!

Jerry: Oh, the IQ thing...yeah.

George: I'm sure I have a low IQ. I've been lying about my SAT scores for 15 years.

Jerry: What did you get?

George: What did I get or what do I say I got?

Jerry: What do you say?

George: I say fourteen o nine (1409).

Jerry: 1409, that's a good score.

George: You're telling me.

Jerry: What did you really get?

George: You are my friend.

Jerry: Of course.

George: I tell you everything, right?

Jerry: I hope so.

George: Well, this I take to the grave.


[Jerry's apartment. Jerry is watching Dream Cafe with binoculars and Elaine is reading a newspaper.]

Jerry: He's serving Mexican ,Italian, Chinese. He's all over the place. That's why no one is going in.

Elaine: Why do you keep watching?

Jerry: I don't know, I'm obsessed with it. It's like a spider in the toilet struggling for a survival. And even if you know it's not going to make it, you kind of root it for awhile.

Elaine: And then you flush.

Jerry: Well, it's a spider.

Elaine: You know, sometimes people won't go in to a place, if they don't see anyone else in there.

[Jerry pulls his sweater over his nose.]

Elaine: You have to do that? Jerry, don't do that, that is so annoying.

Jerry: Bazooka Joe.

[Buzzer rings and Jerry looks at Elaine who is closer to the door.]

Jerry: The buzzer.

Elaine: It's your house.

Jerry: My house? You have to be on the lease to press to buzzer. Yeah?

Intercom: It's George.

Jerry: Come on up.

Elaine: Casus belli.

Jerry: What's that?

Elaine: It's Latin. I read it in some book. I don't know, I just wanted to say it out loud.

Jerry: Go in, go in!

Elaine: Have you gone in there?

Jerry: No, I'm afraid if we start talking, I'm gonna wind up going partners with him.

[George enters. He's got some bagels and big SAT book.]

George: Hi.

Jerry: You know, I could probably shoot him from here. I'd be doing us both a favor.

[Elaine sniffs around.]

George: I'm wearing some cologne, all right?

Elaine: Sure, fine.

Jerry: Casus belli.

Elaine: Casus belli.

George: What's that?

Elaine: Since when do you wear cologne?

George: Why what I do is so important? Why must I be always the vocal point of attention? Let me just be, let me live.

Jerry: Hey, how did you do on that IQ test?

George: I didn't take it yet.

Elaine: What IQ test?

George: What's casus belli.

Jerry: Oh, it's nothing...

George: Is it about me?

Jerry: Why must you always be the vocal point of attention? Why can't you just be? Why can't you live?

Elaine: It's just a Latin phrase George, it does not mean anything. Now, what is this test?

Jerry: This woman he's dating is making him to take this IQ test for this course.

Elaine: Oh, that sounds like fun.

George: Yeah, fun. IQ tests are totally bogus. They prove nothing.

Elaine: You'll do well, you're smart.

Jerry: No see, he's not smart. People think he's smart, but he's not.

Elaine: What did you get on your SAT's?

George: It varies.

Jerry: You know, I don't even know my IQ.

Elaine: Mine's 145.

George: 145!

Jerry: Get out of here!

Elaine: You get out of here!

Jerry: You get out of here!

George: You should take the test for me.

Jerry: Well, that would be something, cheating on a IQ test. Hey, remember in college when you passed Lettick the test out the window? You became a legend after that.

George: Yeah, yeah I really had some guts back then. Why wouldn't we do that again?

Elaine: What?

George: You could take the IQ test for me. I could pass it to you out the window. We could do it, she lives in the first floor.

Elaine: Are you serious?

George: Why not?

Elaine: Where would I take the test?

George: I don't know, she lives right around the corner. Take it here or go to the coffee shop.

Elaine: No, that would be too noisy.

Jerry: Take it to Dream Cafe, you won't hear a peep.

Elaine: Hey, what do you think?

Jerry: Hey, I love a good caper.

Elaine: Yeah, that's what is is, a caper.

George: You'll do it?

Elaine: What the hey.

George: Yeaah, beautiful...[They try to hit a high five, but George hits Elaine in the forehead.] Sorry...


[Dream Cafe. Jerry comes in.]

Babu Bhatt: Welcome to the Dream Cafe.

Jerry: Well, I've been looking forward to it.

Babu: Oh, how did you hear about us?

Jerry: Eh, people, people are talking.

Babu: Smoking or non smoking? We are proud to offer both.

Jerry: Non smoking would be great.

Babu: Very good. My name is Babu Bhatt, I will be your waiter. A steaming hot face cloth for your pleasure.

Jerry: Thank you. [Throws the towel around like a hot potato.]

Babu: Our specials are tacos, moussaka and franks and beans.

Jerry: Well, what do you recommend my good fellow?

Babu: Oh, the turkey.

Jerry: Oh, the turkey it'll be. And may I say you have a splendid establishment here , my friend. I'm sure you flourish in this location for many many years.

Babu: You're a very kind man. Very kind, thank you. Very kind...

Jerry thinks: Very kind. I am a kind man. Who else would do something like this? Nobody. Nobody thinks about people like I do. All right, snap out of it you stupid jerk. You're eating a turkey sandwich. What do want, a nobel price?


[George is taking a test at Monica's bedroom.]

George: You go in the living room. I'll take the test in here.

Monica: But why?

George: I can't concentrate in front of you.

Monica: Oh, I think you're making too much of this. IQ tests don't mean anything.

George: Are you kidding me? This is the best tool we have today of measuring a persons intelligence.

Monica: Well, I certainly don't place any importance on it.

George: Well, I think you're wrong about that. And now if you would excuse me, I would like to get started please.

Monica: Good luck.

George: Don't need it.

[Monica leaves and George runs to the window where Elaine is waiting.]

Elaine: What's been going on in there? I've been standing here for 20 minutes.

George: I'm sorry I'm sorry, here's the test. Thanks again for doing this.

Elaine: All right, what time do you want me back here.

George: Eh, twenty to three.

Elaine: Ok.

George: Thanks again.

Elaine: All right.

George: And don't settle for 145, you can do better, you're a genius.


[Jerry is eating at the Dream Cafe. Babu fills the water for Jerry.]

Jerry: Thank you Babu. You have quite a flair. You are quite the restaurateur I must say.

Babu: It is in deed my pleasure.

Jerry: Oh, please...

[Elaine comes in.]

Babu: Oh, welcome to the Dream Cafe. Our specials today...

Elaine: Oh, no no I'll just have a tea and toast.

Babu: Tea and toast.

Jerry: Eat something! Babu...

Elaine: Um, ok, I'll have the rigatoni.

Babu: Oh, very good choice. Very good.

[Elaine is opening an envelope and is very excited.]

Jerry: Oh wow, so you got the test. You're cheating.

Elaine: I know.

[Kramer comes in.]

Kramer: Hey.

Jerry: Hey.

Kramer: Oh boy. Jerry let me ask you something, hi Elaine...

Elaine: Hey.

Kramer: This guy leaves this jacket at my mothers house two years ago. Now, she hasn't spoken to him since and now he says he wants the jacket back.

Jerry: So?

Kramer: Well, I'm not giving it back.

Jerry: Why not?

Kramer: Because I meat a lot of women in this jacket, you know they're attracted to it. Why do you think my mother went out with him?

[Kramer takes some nachos and spills some to Elaine's test.]

Kramer: Oh, gees...

Elaine: Yeah, ok...[takes the test and goes to another table.]

Kramer: Anyway, it's been two years. I mean isn't there like statue of limitations on that?

Jerry: Statute.

Kramer: What?

Jerry: Statute of limitations. It's not a statue.

Kramer: No, statue.

Jerry: Fine, it's a sculpture of limitations.

Kramer: Just wait a minute...Elaine, Elaine! Now you're smart, is it statue or statute of limitations?

Elaine: Statute.

Kramer: Oh, I really think you're wrong.

Elaine: Look, Kramer, I have to take this test ok, I don't have a long of time.

Kramer: What test?

Elaine: An IQ test.

Kramer: Why do you take an IQ test?

Elaine: It's for George.

Kramer: George?

Elaine: Yeah, can I...can I explain it to you later?

Kramer: Why are you taking an IQ test for George?

Elaine: Would you please?!

Kramer: What, is it for a job or something?

Elaine: Later!

Kramer: You're positive it's statute?

Elaine: Yes, yes!

Babu: Welcome, welcome. A steaming hot face cloth...[gives Kramer a hot towel and Kramer screams and falls from his chair.]


[Monica's. George is reading a New Yorker on the bed and Monica is trying to get in. The door is locked.]

Monica: George?

George: Yeah?

Monica: The door is locked.

George: Oh, it's locked?

Monica: I need to get something.

George: Monica, I'm really focused here, this stuff's a killer.

Monica: George!

George: Wish I could.


[Dream Cafe. Babu is singing and Elaine gets distracted.]

Babu: Ladadeeda, laadadeeda....

Elaine: Babu! If you don't mind?

[Babu comes to collect dishes from Elaine's table and knocks down a cup of coffee.]

Elaine: Oh my God! It's all over the test!

Babu: Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

Elaine: Oh man! Look at this...and I'm late anyway.

Babu: Please, forgive me, please...

Jerry: Go ahead, I'll take care of it.

Babu: I'm very sorry. Tell your friends!

Jerry: It's all right, she was cheating anyway.

Babu: You're a very kind man.

Jerry: Babu, you're Pakistani?

Babu: Yes, Pakistani, yes.

Jerry: Babu, may I say something?

Babu: Of course, you're a very smart man, I'll listen.

Jerry: I'm not a restaurateur by any means, but it occurred to me that perhaps you might serve some dishes from your native Pakistan? As opposed to franks and beans for example.

Babu: But there are no Pakistani people here.

Jerry: Doesn't matter. You would have the only authentic Pakistani restaurant in the whole neighborhood.

Babu: Yes, you see everything, don't you?

Jerry: Well, not everything. I do what I can.

Babu: I'll close down today and when I open again it'll be whole Pakistani restaurant. Thank you, thank you very much, you're very special person, very special.

[Babu leaves]

Jerry thinking: I am such a great guy. Who else would've gone through the trouble of helping this poor immigrant? I am special. My mother was right. Of course I've never had Pakistani food. How bad it could be?


[Elaine is giving the test back to George.]

Elaine: It was an accident.

George: What did you go on a picnic?

Elaine: Babu Bhatt did it.

George: Babu Bhatt? How I'm going to explain this?

Monica: Time's up George.

George: Ok. [George opens the door.] Here you go.

Monica: How did you do?

George: Piece of cake.

Monica: What happened to the test?

George: What? I spilled some food on it.

Monica: Food? What food?

George: What are you talking about?

Monica: Where did you get food?

George: From my pocket.

Monica: What?

George: I eh, I had a sandwich in my pocket.

Monica: And coffee?

George: Yeah, had some coffee, yeah.

Monica: Where did you get the coffee?

George: Where did I get the coffee? Where do think I got the coffee, from the grocery store.

Monica: How did you get there?

George: I walked.

Monica: How did you get out of the apartment? I didn't see you leave.

George: I climbed out the window.

Monica: You climbed out the window?

George: Of course.

Monica: Why didn't you go out the door?

George: The door? Why would I go out the door? The window is right here.

Monica: You are a fascinating man, George Costanza.


[Jerry's apartment, Jerry and Elaine. Jerry is looking Dream cafe with binoculars. There's a sign on the window: Closed for renovation.]

Jerry: Most people in a situation like this, they walk right by it. Not me.

Elaine: You're very special.

[Kramer enters.]

Kramer: Hey, do me a favor. If some guy comes in looking for me, tell him you don't know where I am.

Jerry: Of course, I always do.

Kramer: No, no it's that guy. He's really been bugging me about the jacket.

Elaine: Just give it back to him.

Kramer: Oh, he'll have to kill me. [leaves.]

[Jerry sees George from the window.]

Jerry: Hey Georgie!

George: Coming up.

Jerry: How did you do on the IQ test?!

George: 85!

Jerry: What?!!

George: 85, Jerry! 85 IQ !

[Jerry laughs.]

Elaine: 85?

Jerry: Well, well, well...

Elaine: He's coming up?

Jerry: Well, I'm no genius, but according to my calculations he should be here in a few seconds.

Elaine: Yeah, but an 85, that's ridiculous.

Jerry: Well, maybe the test was gender bias, you know a lot of questions about hunting and testicles...

[George comes in looking angry.]

George: Oh, hello professor.

Elaine: George, I cannot believe...

George: Please...

Elaine: No there has got be a mistake.

George: You should've seen her face. It was the exact same look my father gave me when I told him I wanted to be a ventriloquist.

Jerry: But an 85?

Elaine: There were too many distractions there. Babu...what ever he's name was and Kramer...I couldn't concentrate.

Jerry mocking: It was a madhouse.

Elaine: Jerry! It was! Let me take it again.

George: Whow, forget it.

Elaine: Oh, come on, come on. I guarantee 140. What do you have to lose?

George: You could do worst!

Elaine: No, no, I guarantee it.

George: All right, I'll ask her.

Elaine: Ok, now where I'm going to take it.

Jerry: Take it here, I'll leave, there'll be no distractions.


[Dream Cafe. Babu is on the window looking gloomy. Jerry comes in.]

Jerry: Well, congratulations my friend. You know, I sorry I missed the grand re-opening. I was out of town for about a week.

Babu: You see how I listened. I worked very hard, borrowed more money.

Jerry: I think it's fantastic. Has a certain indefinable charm.

Babu: You wish to eat?

Jerry: Let me tell you something Babu. You go back there in that kitchen and tell your chef I want the works.

Babu: Very good.

Jerry thinking: Very good? No, not very good, very great. I am very, very great.


[Jerry's apartment. Elaine is finishing the test.]

[Monica's bedroom. George is pacing the room.]


[Jerry's monologue.]

You know the IQ test has always that sample question at the beginning where they show how to fill in the circle. It should be the first eliminating point right there. Anybody goes outside of that circle, yeah you wanna come with us, yeah you're done, the test is over, you went outside the circle ok?


[Jerry's apartment. Elaine finishes the test and is packing the stuff.]

[Kramer charges in and locks the door behind him.]

Elaine: What are you doing?

Kramer: Quiet. Shh, don't say anything.

Elaine: What's going on?

Man behind the door: Hey, Kramer! I saw you going there! I'm not leaving until I get the jacket. [Bangs on the door] Open up Kramer!

Elaine: Why did you come in here for?

Kramer: I thought I'd throw him off. See, he knows where I live.

Elaine: Well Kramer, I have to return this test. I've got to get out of here.

Kramer: I thought you took the test.

Elaine: I had to take it again.

Kramer: How come?

Elaine: What's the difference?!!

Kramer: Well, you can't leave now.

Elaine: What?

Man behind the door: Come on, Kramer! I want that jacket back!

Kramer: Never!


[Monica's apartment. George is looking out the window.]

Monica: George, open up.

[George opens the door.]

Monica: Well?

[George shakes her hand.]

George: How' you doing?

Monica: Where's the test?

George: You know, it's the damnedest thing. I went out the window again to get a cup of coffee...


[Dream Cafe. Babu is looking as Jerry eats.]

Jerry: Babu? Babu...[waves Babu to come to table] Babu...you know, I got to tell you, I never do this, but the shrimp, it's just that it's a little stringy. You have any chicken?

Babu: The shrimp is stringy?

Jerry: Well, maybe your refrigerator...

Babu: Quiet!! You shut up! You make me change restaurant, but nobody comes! You say make Pakistani, Babu Bhatt have only Pakistani restaurant. But where are people? You see people? Show me people. There are no people!

Jerry: You know, I think I'll just take the check.

Babu: You bad man! You very very bad man! [leaves]

Jerry thinking: Bad man? Could've my mother been wrong?


[Monica's. Elaine is gently tapping on the bedroom window. Monica comes to open.]

Monica: Are you looking for George?

Elaine: Well eh, kind of....

Monica: George left.

Elaine: Oh.

Monica: Is that the test?

Elaine: Oh, this...emm...yeah...here you go.

Monica: Thanks. I hope you did do a lot better this time.

Elaine: Actually, you know what, I think I did. The first time I couldn't really cons...[Monica closes the window]...entreat.


[At the street. Dream Cafe has a Closed sign on the window and men are carrying furniture out.]
[George, Jerry and Kramer are standing across the street. Kramer has no jacket on.]

Jerry: You know what it was, bad location.

George: Lets not stand here, we might run in to her.

Jerry: Aren't you cold? Where's your jacket?

Kramer: Yeah...

Jerry: Oh, I'm sorry.

Kramer: I'm going upstairs.

[Elaine comes.]

Elaine: Hey guys, I just ran in to Monica. You know what my IQ is? 151.

Jerry: 151?

George: That's a good score.

Jerry: So, what are you up for? How about Mexican?

George: Italian.

Elaine: No, Chinese.

Jerry: You know, what would be great?

[George and Elaine give Jerry a long look.]


[Closing monologue.]

It's tough to do a good deed. Just look at your professional good deed doers. Your lone rangers, your superman, your Batman, your Spiderman, your Elasticman. They are all wearing disguises, masks over their faces. Secret identities. Don't want people to know who they are. It's too much aggravation. "Superman, thanks for saving my life, but did you have to come through my wall? I'm renting here, I've got a security deposit. What am I supposed to do?"


Opening monologue



Jerry: ....hair that was on your shower soap today could be in your head tomorrow. How did they do the first transplant?

Did they have the guy take a shower , get his soap , rush it in there by helicopter, you know

keep the soap alive on the soap support system ....looks it over. "We got the hair but I think we lost

the Zest."

....rejects the transplant with organs.

Is it possible that a head could reject the hair transplant . Guy just standin' there and suddenly...

..Bink! ( motions hair flying out of his head)........lands in someone's frozen yogurt.

Jerry's apartment. A repairman is working on his fridge , Jerry doing work with headphones on.

Repairman: .....The gaskets that you have here are asymmetrical.

Jerry: Ah..ha!.. really. ( Jerry is barely listening to him )

Repairman: So I took off the motor relay on the compressor....'cos you..you (stutters) you've got some discoloration

Jerry: Oh! well whatever you have to do.

Repairman: I was working with one.....mount at a time 'cos you don't wanna disturb the position of the compressor.

Jerry: (sarcastically) No you don't..

George enters the apartment.

George: Hey! what are listening to?

Jerry: My show from last night.

George: Oh! you taped it?

Jerry: Yeah , I was doing new material.

George: Hey! Did 'ya ever do that thing on the toes that I said .

Jerry: Huh?

George: Yeah! like the big toe is like the captain of the toes, but sometimes the toe next to the big toe gets so

big that there's like a power struggle and the second toe assumes control of the foot.

Jerry: The" coup d-toe"

George: Yeah. Did you do it?

Jerry: Yeah!

George: So?

Jerry: Nothin'.....nothing at all.

George: Need to use the phone.

Jerry: Who you calling?

George: China.

Jerry: China really?

George: Yeah. I'll pay for it.

Jerry: What for?

George: What for? . I'll tell you what for.... for hair.

Jerry: Hair?

George: The Chinese have done it my friend . The Chinese have done it.

Jerry: Done what?

George: Discovered a cure for baldness.

Repairman: Did you see that last night?

George: It was on CNN ( Kramer comes in and he is taping from a Camcorder) This Chinese doctor Zeng Zau.

has discovered a cure for baldness.

Jerry: ( to Kramer) What's this?

Kramer: Well I just got it. Spector gave it to me , he's giving everything away...becoming a minimalist.

George: Is that the guy who likes fat women?

Jerry: Doesn't the fat fetish conflict with the minimalism.

Kramer: ( to George) You , you know what you should've done is watching that report on CNN last night.

George: I did, I'm trying to call China.

Kramer: You can't call China now its like, what, three 'O clock in the morning there

Jerry; Oh! my God!....

George: What?

Jerry: Oh! God.. Oh! man.....Oh! brother!!! I can't believe what I'm hearing. This woman his talking to

Listen to this.

George: (George puts on the headphones) Oh! my god...

Kramer: Give me it..( tries to pull them off George's head)

George: Wa..Wait.Wait!......Who is this woman?

Jerry: I don't know . I have no idea . I was just listening and she came on.

George: This is like a Penthouse letter...Why can't I meet women like this?

Kramer: All right Come on....again attempts to pull headphones off)

George: WAIT ,WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!!!!.... Where was the tape recorder?

Jerry: It was in the back of the room on the left, she must have been sitting right in front of it.

George: My god!!!

Kramer: C'mon it's my turn.

Jerry: Good question.

Kramer: Where's the volume..(finds it) A, YAI..YA...YA..YA!!!!



Cut to Monks



George: What do the Chinese have to gain by faking a cure for baldness?

Jerry: If it was real ,they would never let it out of the country. No baldness , it'd be like a nation of Supermen.

Elaine: Hi boys.

Both: Hello...

Elaine: What's happening?

Jerry: Tell her. I wanna hear her reaction.

George: I thought you meant the..

Jerry: No I meant the bald cure. We were talking about the bald cure.

Elaine: What did she say?

Peter: Seinfeld.....( from way in the back of the restaurant. Cheesy plot device to have Jerry leave the

table for a minute so George and Elaine can talk)

Jerry: Hey! Is that Peter? ...I can't believe it. Get me a cup of Decaf.( leaves table)

Elaine: So did you hear this message?

George: Oh!, he he, It was unbelievable

Elaine: Really!

George: Yeah. I can't get over it.

Elaine: Huh! Sexy?

George: This woman drove us out of our minds

Elaine: Like ...humm...How did she sound?

Jerry comes back

Jerry: Remember Peter?

George: Peter?

Jerry: You remember Peter. remember I told you how he went to the track that one time and he was yelling at this

jockey and the jockey got off the horse and started chasin' him.

Elaine: So listen , what about this girl on the tape recorder?

Jerry: Oh Elaine....What do you think an enraptured female fan of mine might say?

Elaine: I don't know.

Jerry: She went on in some detail about certain activities, illegal in some states, for consenting adults.

Things you would know very little about.

Elaine: Oh! really.

Jerry: Well this type of things is very common when you're in show business.

Elaine: So what, Are you gonna ask her out.

Jerry: No I can't she didn't leave her name or number.

Elaine: Bummer...Okay , good luck finding her . I'm taking off.

George: Wh.. Where you going?

Elaine: Home.

George: Why you going home for?

Elaine: Well , I just came from the gym , unless I can shower at your place.

Jerry: Sure.





Back to Jerry's

George: Oh! my god. Oh! man...

Jerry: I don't get it. Why would a woman do that and then leave no way to get in touch with her.

Elaine: (coming out of the shower in a bathrobe) May be she realized she could never have you and she jumped off

the George Washington Bridge.

George: (phone rings ,picks up) Operator? Beijing?

Jerry: Why are you doing this?

George: Why do I do anything? tsss...For women.

Jerry: Elaine have you ever gone out with a bald man?

Elaine: No.

Jerry: You know what that makes you?...A baldist.

George: Oh. This I need. Hello!! Hello. i..i..is this the hair restoration clinic? ...Does anyone speak English?



Elaine: ( to Kramer who just got in with his camcorder) Ooooh! You're taping.

West side"

Elaine: ( to the camera) Hi. How 're you doin'?

George: English. Does anybody speak English .Nobody speaks English.

Kramer: So What scene are you ready to shoot now , Elaine?

George: In this scene my co-star who's right over here ( goes over to George who is still on the phone)

Door buzzer rings

Kramer: That's my Chinese food...So George is this your first movie with Elaine?

George: (visibly disturbed) I...I..I dunno.

Kramer: So Elaine in your movies is the sex real or is it simulated?

Elaine: Oh. it's always simulated....except with George that's in my contract.

George: All right, Kramer that's it.....( pushes the camera) Hello . English. Does anyone speak English

Kramer: ( to the Chinese delivery boy) How much do I owe you?

Ping: $15.90.

Elaine: Well ya. I guess so Why? You wanna do something?

Elaine: Pffft....there's really nothing to do.

George: ( becoming more and more awkward) Yeah.....

Elaine: Do you think of anything?..

George: No, no....(mumbles)

Elaine: I am up for anything.

George: Really...(he honks the car and is startled, Elaine laughs)......I have to say...You were really good

doing that porno thing....you're talented.

Elaine: I was just kiddin, around.......

George: I thought the thing you said about the sex not being simulated . That was really funny.

Elaine: ( feeling awkward as well) Yeah! that was a...f...fun ..mmm?.

George; So all right I'll speak to you through Jerry and everything.

Elaine: Okay...Thanks a lot for the ride.



Elaine gets out of the car , George tries to catch his breath.

Back to Jerry's.

Jerry: ..She was sitting at the table where I had my tape recorder...Okay great. Thanks again.. bye.

HA Ha..Who do these women think they're dealing with? Did she think she was gonna leave this incredibly

erotic message on my tape and I was just gonna let it go. Not Bloody likely...

Kramer: What is that?

Jerry: That's my cockney accent.

kramer: Naw ,na , that's no good.

Jerry: Lets hear yours.

Kramer: Not bloody likely..

Jerry: That's the worst cockney accent I've ever heard in my life.( George enters) Hey! Georgie boy , guess what I

got.

George; Guess, what I got.

Jerry: Oh! Is that the bald stuff?

George: From China. All the way from China.

Kramer: Wait,wait wait...Let me get the camera.

George: No Don't get the camera , we don't need the camera. Listen I know your skeptical , but I really believe

in the Chinese.

Jerry: Yes I am skeptical.

George: Why do you have to be so suspicious of every one. This is a great man Zeng Zau, he wants to help bald people.

Kramer: W..W..Wa...Wa..Wait..Wait wait.. Now lets videotape your head for the before picture, so we can watch

how it grows and stuff. Sit down (George sits).....Lean back...A little bit to the right.

Jerry: Make sure you get this area here, where he needs the help....

George: All right, all right ( Goes to the bathroom)

Kramer: He's a happy camper huh?

Jerry: Happy camper , I don't hear that expression enough.

Kramer; Remember that guy who took my jacket. The one I found at my mother's house.

Jerry: Yeah.

Kramer: My mother told me that he got arrested for mail fraud

Jerry: No kidding?

Kramer: He's in jail.

Jerry: What happened to the jacket. Did he take it with him?

Kramer: That's what I intend to find out. (George comes out of the bathroom and he's got white cream on his head)

Jerry: You can see it. You gonna walk around like that?

Kramer: It stinks. Can you smell that?....You stink.

Jerry: How long are you suppose to leave it on for?

George: All day. ( phone rings , Jerry picks up)

Jerry: Hello.

Elaine: It's Elaine Marie Benes.

Jerry: Well Hello..

Elaine: Hello.. so did you ever find out who that woman was?

Jerry: Yes , I got her number.

George: Is that Elaine?

Jerry: Yeah.

George: HI ELAINE...

Elaine: I guess you figure you're in for a pretty wild night?

Jerry: Well , as I said this type of thing is very common in show business

Elaine: Well listen I'm going to (?) do you want me to stop by?

George: Did she say Hello?

Jerry: What? I dunno.

George: I mean , when I said Hello did she say Hello back?

Jerry: I don't know , Who keeps track of Hellos.

George: Isn't polite to say Hello when somebody says hello?

Jerry: She's coming up.

George: Elaine's coming up?

Jerry: Yeah. What's wrong, why? ( George runs back to the bathroom)

Kramer: How often do you cut your toe nails?

Jerry: I would say every two and a half to eight weeks.

Kramer: 'cos the other night , you know, I was sleeping with Marion I rolled over and I cut her ankle

with my big toe.

Jerry: The big toe; The captain.

Kramer: What?

Jerry; The captain of the toes. ( phone rings) Hello.

Elaine: Jerry...Jerry listen I got too much stuff this afternoon, I can't come over, forget it.

Jerry: Okay....too bad.

Elaine: So humm....When you gonna call her?

Jerry: Soon as I get off the phone wih you.

Elaine: Good luck.

Jerry: okay , bye ( to George) What happened , did you take it off?

George: Yeah, that was enough.

Jerry: That's it, you gave up?

George: No No I'm working on a system...Who was that?

Jerry: That was Elaine , she changed her mind. She's not coming over.

As Jerry dials the girls number, George races to the bathroom one more time.

Alicia: Hello.

Jerry: Hello is this Alicia? .This is Jerry Seinfeld.

Alicia: Yeah.

jerry: This is Jerry Seinfeld.

Cuts to commercial. Back to Jerry's after an implied date with Alicia

Jerry: (to Kramer) ...( words missing)...laugh , everything's nice and at the end of the night I go for

a little contact. I get the PULL BACK. This woman said the filthiest things I've ever heard in

my life. I get the Pull Back.

Door buzzer

Jerry: Yeah..

George: It's George.

Jerry: Come on up . (looks at his watch) ...What's he doing here now?

Kramer: So , you blew it?

Jerry: She must be psychotic or something.

Kramer: Let me have her number.

Jerry: I'm not giving you her number.

Kramer: I know how to handle these psychotics.

George comes in wearing a huge cowboy hat.

Jerry: Sheriff?........What's with the hat?

Kramer: (George takes off the hat , he's got that cream on again) Pheeewwww! Boy! You stink.

Jerry: What are doing here now?

George: I have to talk to you about something .

Kramer: All right lets take a look to see what we got ( examines George's head) Wait a second..

George: I can't tell ya now , he's gonna be back in a ten seconds.

Jerry: So just start it.

George: I can't.

Jerry: Oh! Come om . He'll be over there for a half hour, he gets lost over there.

C'mon so what is this about?

George: All right.........I've become attracted to Elaine..

Kramer burst in with is video setup.

Kramer; All right....Sit down George.

George: Kramer, can we do this later..

Kramer: No, I got the tape right here.

Jerry: Kramer, let's do this later.

Kramer: (ignoring them) Now.. This is the tape that we made earlier and I think ,that I see. a couple of buds

right here.

George: Really? ..You think.

Jerry: Kramer. I would like to talk to George for a minute, please.

Kramer: 'bout what?

Jerry: It's kinda private.

Kramer: Like the big toe captain..

George: So now you're doing my bits?

Jerry: I'M NOT DOING YOUR BITS!!

Kramer: Okay , all right. I'm gonna take a look at this huh!.( leaves)

Jerry: Does she know?

George: NO!!

Jerry: How did it happen?

George: I can't say.

Jerry: Well, why can't you say it?

George: Because I promised her.

Jerry: I thought you just said she doesn't know??

George: She doesn't.

Jerry: So how can you promise her?

George: Because she asked me to.

Jerry: What is this, an Abbott and Costello routine?

George: All right You really want to know?...It all started when she told met hat...she was the voice

on your tape recorder.

Jerry: What, Elaine?

George: Yeah! She made me promise not to tell you .It's supposed to be a joke.

Jerry: (picks up the headphones) That was Elaine...

George: Well let me hear....( they struggle for the headphones)

Jerry: Wait a second. .Just give me a second

George: You heard it fifty times already.

Jerry: She's my ex-girlfriend I think I have precedence

Door Buzzer

Jerry: Yeaaaah!!!

Elaine: Hi, It's Elaine is this a bad time?

George grabs his hat and rushes to the bathroom again.

George: ( Yelling from the bathroom) Don't tell her anything , she'll kill me!!

Jerry: Okay, Okay ,I promise. ( puts on the headphones again) Wow!!! Oh Man...Oh God..

Oh Brother....Whoooaaaa!! Whoaaaa ( Elaine enters he takes them off rapidly)

Elaine: ( Concerned) What's the matter?

Jerry: Oooh! I got a pain in my side.

Elaine: ( to George returning) Hi George. Something stinks in here.( George motions to Jerry, she nods)

Jerry: What are you doing here?

Elaine: I was the one who talked into your tape recorder.

Jerry; I know, George told me.

Elaine; You told him!!!!

George: He..He threatened me.

Jerry: Where did you come up with all that stuff?

Elaine: That was nothing.

George: Elaine.. I have to tell you something...

Jerry: George NO!!

George: No no no no no no no..

Jerry: George I'm telling ya..

Elaine: What is it?

George: I'm very attracted to you..

Jerry: Aye......

Kramer comes in and yells

Kramer: I'VE FOUND A HAIR!!! Yes ( goes up to the video machine and inserts the tape)

Hey, come here, come here ,take a look at this.

George: Ever since I found out that you let that message on Jerry's tape recorder I...

Credits start to roll

Kramer: Whoa!!!....That was you?

Elaine: It was a joke...

Kramer: Wait..( picks up the walkman) Oh my god...Oh yeah....Elaine , I can't believe that that is

Elaine: Aah.... ( she stares at the three of them all lined up like the Daltons ,all looking at her

with lust.) I think I'll get going...

George: Heuh. huh. Stick around a while.

Jerry: It's early.

Kramer: We'll order Chinese.

She leaves and they all scramble for the tape recorder.



End

Opening monologue.

Can you give me an explanation as to why the pharmacist has to be two-and-a-half
feet up above everybody else? What the hell is he doing, he can't be down there
on the floor with you and me? Brain surgeons, airline pilots, nuclear
physicists, we're all on the same level. Oh no, he's gotta be two-and-a-half
feet up. "Look out, everybody, I'm working with pills. Spread out, give me
some room." The only hard part of his whole job that I could see is typing
everything onto that little tiny label. He has to try and get all the words on
there, keep the paper in the- it's a little piece of paper, in the roller of the
typewriter. Oh no, he's gotta be two-and-a-half feet up. "Yeah, I'd like to
get this prescription filled." "Alright, and you wait down there, only I'm
allowed up here."



First scene.

Jerry and George are at a newsstand.

George: Where'd you meet her?

Jerry: I met her on an elevator.

George: On an elevator? You met a woman on an elevator?

Jerry: Impossible, right?

George: You got less than sixty seconds. That's like dismantling a time bomb.

What got into you?

Jerry: I don't know. She was so beautiful, it was like a pure reflex. The

words just came out of my mouth.

George: Wow. What'd you say?

(flashback to Jerry and Isabel on the elevator)

Jerry: You know, I'm the one responsible for those crop circles in England.

(end of flashback)

George: Wow.

Jerry: Can you believe I did that?

George: What did she say?

(another flashback)

Isabel: What crop circles?

(end of flashback)

Jerry: Not a good sign.

George: Not everybody knows what the crop circles are. (to the newsstand

owner) Do you know what the crop circles are?

Newsstand owner: Crop circles? Why don't you buy something?

Jerry: You got something in your teeth there.

George: What?

Jerry: It's green.

George: Oh, man, it's spinach! I've been walking around like this all

afternoon.

Jerry: Did you bump into anybody you knew?

George: I had a job interview.

Jerry: How'd it go?

George: Take a guess.

(flashback to George's job interview, with close-ups of George's spinached

teeth.)

Interviewer: Well, Mr. Costanza, we have nothing available at the present time,

but should anything open up, we'll be in touch.

George: Ok, thanks.

(end of flashback)

Jerry: What do you need a job, you got Audrey.

George: Yeah, right.

Jerry: What's the matter?

George: Oh, nothing.

Jerry: What?

George: You won't think I'm a bad person?

Jerry: Too late for that.

George: 'Cause believe me, I would only say this to you and maybe a

psychiatrist, maybe. Well, her nose is a little big.

Jerry: Yeah, she's got a big nose.

George: I mean, big would even be ok, a little beyond big.

(momentary flashback to Audrey's tremendous nose)

Jerry: It's a schnoz.

George: Now, I'm aware that my own physical dimensions are perhaps a little

short of perfection.

Jerry: A little.

George: So who am I to be thinking about someone's nose? I mean, I should be

grateful someone like her even looks at me. I have no job, nothing. But I have

to say, I think about the nose. I don't want to think about the nose. I don't

ask to think about the nose, but I think about it. I go to bed at night, I tell

myself, 'Don't think about the nose, forget the nose,' but I think about it. I

look at her, I see nose.

Jerry: Stop being so concerned with looks.

(momentary flashback to Isabel giving Jerry her number)

Jerry: Have you said anything to her about it?

George: I could never do that. You know the ironic thing is if she had a

smaller nose, I never could have gone out with her in the first place. She'd be

out of my league with a smaller nose. And I really like her, I know that. And

I know one other thing. I'm not getting past that nose.

Jerry: Alright, shut up, here they come.

George (waving): How can I not think about it? Look at the size of this thing.



New scene.

Jerry, Elaine, George, Audrey and Kramer are sharing a pizza at Jerry's

apartment.

Kramer: So my mother's going out with this guy who leaves a jacket in her house

so, you know, she gives it to me. Well, two years later he shows up and he

takes it back. And now he's in prison. He got arrested for mail fraud. So

Elaine, all you have to do is go over to the apartment, tell the landlord that

you're his daughter and you want to bring him the jacket in prison.

Elaine: Won't the landlord know I'm not the daughter?

Kramer: No no, he's never met her. She's in California.

Elaine: Are you coming with me?

Kramer: Oh, yeah yeah, I have to. I'm your fianc, Peter Von Nostrand.

George: Why don't you just commit yourself already?

Audrey: What is so special about this jacket?

Elaine: He believes it possesses some extraordinary power over women.

Audrey: What's the smudge on your hand?

Kramer: Oh, I got stamped at the reggae lounge last night. Yeah, I'm going

back there tonight, you know, I'm not gonna pay another cover charge.

George: What, you didn't wash all day?

Kramer: Yeah, I washed, just not the hand. You wouldn't believe the women at

this club. Ohh, man.

Audrey: It's amazing how many beautiful women live in New York. I actually

find it kind of intimidating.

Kramer: Well, you're as pretty as any of them, you just need a nose job.

Elaine: Kramer!

Kramer: What? What?

Elaine: How could you say something like that?!

Kramer: What? What do you mean? I just said she needs a nose job.

Elaine: No no, there's nothing wrong with her nose! I'm so sorry, Audrey.

Audrey: No, it's ok.

Elaine: What did you have to say that for?

Kramer: Well, I was just trying to help out.

Elaine: Yeah? Well, you can kiss that jacket goodbye, Mr. Von Nozzin.

Kramer: You see what happens when you try to be nice?





Mid-episode monologue.

But what would the world be like if people said whatever they were thinking, all

the time, whenever it came to them? How long would a blind date last? About

thirteen seconds, I think. "Oh, sorry. Your rear end is too big." "That's ok,

your breath stinks anyway. See you later, no problem, good-bye, ok, thank you

very much."





New scene.

George and Audrey are in Elaine's apartment.

Audrey: Elaine said I could stay with her another month until Tina gets back.

What are you thinking about?

George: Thinking? Nothing. What could I possibly be thinking?

Audrey: You look like you've got something on your mind.

George: Oh, yeah, right. I wish I had something on my mind. (pregnant pause)

So how about that Kramer, huh?

Audrey: How about him?

George: They way he just says stuff.

Audrey: He sure does.

George: Yeah. Yeah, he's quite a character.

Audrey: So, what did you think?

George: About the pizza?

Audrey: No, about the nose job.

George: Oh, the nose job. I don't know, what did you think?

Audrey: Well, I've thought about it, but I don't know.

George: Yeah. (another pause) Not that I care, one way or the other, but

these doctors today really do amazing things, you know, if you were so inclined.

And again, I'm not suggesting.

Audrey: I know, they're good.

George: Peter Jennings had one.

Audrey: Really?

George: Probably. They all do. In my high school, half my graduating class

had them. Of course, I'm from Long Island, so...

Audrey: Uh huh.

George: It's really nothing, it's like going to the dentist.

Audrey: I hate the dentist.

George: It's a cleaning.

Audrey: So you really think I should do this?

George: If it makes you happy, I don't focus on these things. I will tell you

this: Unfortunately, we live in a very superficial society. I don't condone

it, but it's a fact of life.

Audrey: Well, maybe I should.

George: What the hell.

Elaine (barging in): Aw, now you talked her into getting a nose job?

George: Me? I didn't say anything.

Elaine: You encouraged her to get one.

George: I didn't encourage. No encourage.

Elaine: Peter Jennings had one?

George: It's possible.

Elaine: Well, I think you should accept her for who she is.

Audrey: No, George is right. I want to get one.

Elaine: I think it's a mistake.

George: Me too, really. Unless you'd really like to get one.



New scene.

Jerry and George are at the coffee shop.

George: I'm going straight to hell, no two ways about it.

Jerry: Well, it might not be hell but you're gonna run into some bad dudes.

George (checking his watch): Hey, let's get the check, she's taking the

bandages off at four o'clock.

Jerry: We have time.

George: It's exciting, isn't it? She's gonna have a whole new face.

Jerry: It is exciting.

George: Of course, not as exciting as miss crop circles, but...

Jerry: Please, please, Isabel? She is the most despicable woman I have ever

met in my life. I have never been so repulsed by someone mentally and so

attracted to them physically at the same time. It's like my brain is facing my

penis in a chess game. And I'm letting him win.

George: You're not letting him win. He wins till you're forty.

Jerry: Then what?

George: He still wins but it's not a blowout.

Jerry: She wants to be an actress. She makes me read these moronic acting

scenes with her, and I do it because I'm so addicted to the sex, I'm helpless,

I'll do anything. So finally Kramer comes in the other day.

(flashback to Kramer and Jerry in Jerry's apartment)

Jerry (holding up a piece of paper): I don't want to see this woman anymore but

I haven't got the will power to throw out her number. Please, help me. Help

me.

Kramer (taking the paper and tearing it to pieces): I'm proud of you.

(end of flashback)

Jerry: So I'm never gonna see her again, I'm going cold turkey.

George: Good for you.

Jerry: I'll tell you, the sex... I mean, I was like an animal. I mean it was

just completely uninhibited.

George: It's like going to the bathroom in front of a lot of people and not

caring.

Jerry: It's not like that at all.



New scene.

Elaine, George, Jerry, Kramer and Audrey are at Elaine's apartment.

Elaine: How do you even know the jacket is there?

Kramer: Well I don't, I'm guessing.

George: Okay, look, Audrey, before you take the bandage off just remember that

I was the one that encouraged you to do this, you know? Now that you're gonna

be a great beauty, let's not forget how this all began. You know, like if you'd

listened to your friend, Elaine,

Audrey: George?

George: Yeah?

Audrey: Enough.

Jerry: Alright, are we ready? Come on, let's get this show on the road.

Elaine: Are you sure you want us here for this?

Audrey: Yes.

Jerry: Shouldn't a doctor do it?

Audrey: No, he said I could do it. Okay, here goes.

George: Very exciting, very exciting, it's like watching a birth.

Audrey removed the bandage, the gang tries to disguise their horror.

Elaine: It looks good.

Jerry: Great job.

Kramer: You got butchered.

George faints.

An undetermined time later, Jerry and Elaine are helping George to his feet.

Jerry: Let's put him over here.

Kramer (to a fleeing Audrey): Where are you going?

Audrey (with hand covering nose): To the doctor!

Kramer: Wait, wait, wait, I'll go with you.

Kramer leaves, Elaine sits on the couch near George.

Elaine: How ya feeling?

George: Too much salt in my diet.

Elaine: Can I get you anything?

George: Nah, I'm good.

Elaine: You sure? Anything?

George: Mmm, no. Boy, it really didn't come out too well, did it?

Elaine: No, it didn't. No, it didn't.

George: It's like, all dented.

Elaine: Seems to be.

George: Well, I'm sure they'll be able to fix it. You can't stop modern

science. Can't stop it, you can't stop it. Can't stop science. Can't be

stopped, no way, no how, science just marches--

Elaine: Shut up, George.

George: Shut up?

Elaine: Yeah.

George: Interesting.



New scene.

Jerry and Kramer are at Jerry's apartment. Kramer is pouring a bowl of cereal,

Jerry has cracked.

Jerry: Come on, Kramer, seriously, give me her number!

Kramer: I don't have it, I threw it out.

Jerry: You're lying! You got it, I want that number!

Kramer: I told you, I threw it out.

Jerry: Give it to me!

Kramer: You told me not to give it to you, you made me promise.

Jerry: Well, I changed my mind, I want that number.

Kramer: You said, no matter what you do or say, I'm not to give you the number.

Jerry: I was lying, give it to me!

Kramer: No, you told me not to!

Jerry: I want that number!

Kramer: Alright! (flinging pieces of torn paper to the ground) Yeah! Yeah!

Yeah! (Jerry falls to the floor and starts arranging pieces) Look at you!

Look at what you've sunk to! Look at what you've become! Look in the mirror,

cause you need help, Jerry. You need help, because I can't stand by and do it

anymore. It's turning my stomach! I can't stand around here watching you

destroy yourself. It's eating me up inside!

Kramer storms out, then storms back in to grab the box of cereal and the bowl,

then storms out again.



New scene.

George and Audrey are at the coffee shop, Audrey is talking about her nose,

George is trying not to look at it.

Audrey: The doctor said that they need to build the lateral wall of the septum.

Over here...

George: Yeah.

Audrey: You see this perinasal sinus cavity?

George: Oh, I got it.

Audrey: You see how it's collapsing? That's what's causing this huge dent.

George: Yeah, phew.

Audrey: So anyway, George, do you know what I was thinking about?

George: What?

Audrey: Remember we talked about taking a trip together?

George: We did?

Audrey: Yeah, we talked about going to Hawaii?

George: Hawaii?

Audrey: Anyway, I think it would be great to get away after all this.

George (removing his glasses) You know, Hawaii could be a little tricky right

now, there's a lot of high pressure winds down there this time of year, there's

a lot of debris constantly flying around. Wood, and uh, lava, pretty dangerous.

Audrey: I never heard that.

George: Oh yeah. My friend lived there.

Audrey: We could go to the Caribbean.

George: You know, I have to tell you something. You couldn't get me on a plane

right now. I get those FAA reports directly. My uncle sends them to me, he

used to be a pilot, so. Big investigation in the, uh, what's the word there,

uh, offing. It's in the offing. But, you know, you shouldn't let that stop you

from going. You could go. I don't mind.

Audrey: George, I don't think this is working.



New scene.

Jerry is rehearsing with Isabel.

Isabel: Ever since you came back from the Army, you've changed. I swear

Nelson, I don't even know who you are anymore.

Jerry: I'm Nelson!

Isabel: That's not the line, Jerry.

Jerry: Alright, alright, I'm sorry. (reading) Nothing's changed, Alma, I just

need more time.

Isabel: I swear, Nelson, sometimes at night, when you're not around, I just go

crazy thinking about you.

Jerry: Well, you just need to relax. Maybe a hobby, bowling is fun.

Isabel: Yeah, bowling's good if you're really gross and ugly.

Jerry (to himself): Uh oh. My organs are playing chess again.



Cut to the table where a slightly translucent Jerry's brain is playing chess

with a similarly visible Jerry's penis.

Jerry's Brain: Well I'm getting a little tired of this. What do you say we

play one for all the marbles?

Jerry's Penis: Oh Brain, what are you doing? You cannot beat me. Do you have

any idea who you're dealing with? Forget about it!

Jerry's Brain: I can't take her anymore. I hate reading her stupid little

acting scenes.

Jerry's Penis: Oh, so what? So you read from a little play. You can't put up

with that for an hour to make me happy? You're so selfish. Give me one hour,

then I will take over, you will not have to think for the rest of the night.

Jerry's Brain: What about tomorrow morning? Do you have any idea what that's

like for me? Do you care? No, you don't care. So long as you get to do

whatever it is you do. You disgust me.

Jerry's Penis: Oh, go read a book.

Jerry's Brain: Enough chatting, let's play.



New scene.

Elaine and Kramer are outside the landlord's apartment.

Elaine: You know the only reason I'm doing this is because you took Audrey to

the hospital.

Kramer (filling a pipe): Yeah, yeah, ok, now uh, you're clear, you got

everything?

Elaine: Yeah.

Kramer: Wait wait wait wait wait. (putting a ring on Elaine's finger) Here.

Elaine: What do I need this for?

Kramer: Because we're engaged.

Elaine: We're engaged?

Kramer: Um hm.

Elaine: Kramer, this is too big.

Kramer (lighting his pipe): It's my mom's.

A stout man walks around the corner.

Landlord: Hello?

Elaine: Oh, uh, hi. I'm Wanda Pepper, I'm Albert Pepper's daughter. My father

asked me to come here and pick up his jacket for him.

Landlord: Oh, hello Miss Pepper, it's a pleasure to meet you. (To Kramer) And

you must be Professor Von Nostrand?

Kramer: Yes, yes I am.

Landlord: I've read your book, Professor, and I was quite intrigued by it.

Kramer: Uh, yes. Well, it's, uh, very intriguing.

Landlord: Tell me, is it your contention that Shakespeare was an imposter?

Kramer: My contention?

Landlord: Yes, your contention.

Kramer: Yes, that's my contention.

Elaine: I heard him contend that.

Landlord: It's too bad about your father.

Elaine: Oh, it was a frame-up.

Landlord: A fine man, he spoke often of you. He's very proud of the work

you're doing.

Elaine: Oh, well, we're all proud of the work I'm doing.

Kramer: She does fine work.

Landlord: Your father gave me strict orders not to turn the jacket over to

anyone, but I suppose I can make an exception in your case. The closet's this

way.

Elaine: How kind of you.

Landlord: You know, your father has a very extensive wardrobe.

Kramer enters after Elaine, banging his pipe on the door frame.



New scene.

Jerry's Brain and Penis are still playing chess, Jerry's Brain appears to have

the upper hand.

Jerry's Brain: What's the matter, fella? You look a little tired. Ha ha ha ha

ha!

Isabel: Nelson, don't you see? You are a part of me, and I, I am a part of

you.

Jerry's Penis: It's killing me. (Makes a move)

Jerry's Brain: That's your move?

Jerry's Penis: Yeah.

Jerry's Brain: Well that's trouble, my friend. That's big trouble. Checkmate!

Jerry's Penis (beginning to cough and struggle): Getting weak... Losing

power... You haven't seen the last of me. I'll be back. You're nothing

without me. Nothing!

Jerry's Penis disappears with an audible pop.

Jerry's Brain (before disappearing himself): Punk.

Jerry: Isabel, uh, I don't think this is working.

Isabel checks the script with a puzzled look on her face.



Back to Elaine, Kramer and the landlord at Albert Pepper's apartment.

Elaine: Daddy certainly does have an extensive wardrobe.

Landlord: He is a fine dresser and I'm sure I don't have to tell you he's quite

popular with the ladies.

Elaine: My father, really? I had no idea.

Landlord: Yes, they're crazy about him. There was one in particular, came

around about two years ago, looked a lot like you, Professor. Could have been

your mother. What was her name again? Carter? Kramer! That's it, Babs

Kramer. Nasty woman, many a night I had to throw her out on the street, drunken

stumblebum.

Kramer: You don't say?

Elaine: I found it!

Landlord: The woman used to walk around here half naked, sucking Colt 45 from a

can. Her big fat stomach hanging out, orthopedic hose up to her knees,

screaming down the hall, "Come back to bed, Albert, you big hairy ape, and bring

back that box of Danish!"

Throughout the landlord's narrative, Kramer becomes more and more agitated.

Finally, he grabs the pipe out of his mouth.



New scene.

The four are at their usual booth at the coffee shop.

Kramer: So I grabbed the guy by the collar.

Elaine: Yeah, and I yelled out, Kramer! Kramer, you're killing him!"

Jerry: So I assume the jig was up.

Elaine: Yeah, pretty much.

Kramer shows off the fruits of their labor; he's wearing the jacket. Audrey

walks in, her nose has been repaired and she's absolutely beautiful.

Audrey: Hi.

Elaine: Hi!

Jerry: Hey.

Audrey (to George): Hello.

George (smitten): Audrey? My god, you look incredible! I can't believe it!

Audrey (motioning to Kramer): Well, it was his doctor. He was wonderful.

Elaine: So, will I see you later tonight?

Audrey: Not sure.

Kramer (rising and putting his arm around Audrey's shoulder): Well, I'll check

you guys out later. (To Audrey) Ready?

Audrey (holding up her hand to show the stamp): I didn't wash.

Kramer: Neither did I. We're off to the Reggae Lounge.

Elaine (after they leave): Isn't she beautiful? Her nose is in such perfect

proportion with the rest of her face. She's breathtaking! Who would have

though she's like--

George (interrupting): Elaine. Shut up.



Closing monologue

The technical term for a nose job is rhinoplasty. Rhino, okay? Do we really
need to insult the person at this particular moment of their lives? They know
they have a big nose, that's why they're coming in. Do they really need the
abuse of being compared to a rhinoceros on top of everything else? When someone
goes in for a hair transplant, they don't go, "We're going to perform a
cue-ballectomy on you, Mr. Johnson. We're going to attempt to remove the
skinheadia of your chrome-domus which is the technical term."

Opening monologue

So I was in the drug store the other day, trying to get a cold medication.  You
ever try and pick one of these out?  It's not easy.  It's a wall.  It's an
entire wall of cold medication, you stand there, you're going, "Alright,
alright, alright, okay, what the hell--  This is quick acting, but this is long
lasting.  When do I need to feel good, now or later?"  It's a tough question.
And they always show you the commercials on TV where they show you what's wrong
with the guy, you know?  They always show you, like, all the problems that he's
having.  First of all, the always show you the human body, which is usually this
guy.  No face, mouth open, this is how drug companies see the public.  And he's
always in, like, a certain pain, it's like red wavy lines are going through him
or he's glowing, parts of him are on fire sometimes, lightning is attacking him.
I never had a doctor say to me, "Are you having any pain?"  "Yes I am."  "Are
you having any lightning with the pain?"


First scene.
Jerry and George are in a drug store.

Jerry:  How did you get fleas?

George:  Because my cousin's imbecile dog was rolling around outside and they
got in his carpet.

Jerry:  Maybe you can get yourself a little bowtie flea collar.

George:  That's not funny.  So, are you coming to the party?

Jerry:  I'd go, but Long Island, it's so far out, it smacks of desperation.  The
whole party, everyone's gonna be saying to me, "You came all the way out from
Manhattan for this?"

George:  You know Ava's gonna be there.

Jerry:  Who?

George:  The nice one that works in my office.

Jerry:  Nah.

George:  I'll drive.

Jerry:  Oh, well, now you're talking.

George:  It's supposed to be a good party.

Jerry:  What does that mean, good dip?

George:  No, there'll be girls there.

Jerry:  There's girls everywhere.  I go out of my apartment, there's girls in
the elevator.  They're in cafeterias, subways, so what?

George:  There's a hundred different things here.  What's the difference between
these two?  (They each grab a box and check the ingredients)  You got
propylparabin?

Jerry:  Got it.

George:  You got isobutane-30?

Jerry:  I got isobutane-20.

George:  A-ha.

Jerry:  You got  sorbitant sesquioliate?

George:  Got it.

Jerry:  I have aloe!

George:  You got aloe?  I love aloe.

Jerry:  Where do they make yours?

George:  Jersey.

Jerry:  White Plains.

George puts down the "Jersey" box and grabs the "White Plains" box from Jerry
and they go to the check out counter.  Two women are standing at the magazine
rack in the background.

Jerry:  Girls.  There's girls right here in the store.  Look, look, there's one
over there.  Look, there's another one.  Soon as I walk outside there'll be
girls out there.  What's the matter?

George:  I gave her a twenty, she only gave me change for a ten.

Jerry:  Are you sure?  Oh boy, here we go.

George (to the cashier):  Excuse me, I gave you a twenty dollar bill and you
only actually gave me change for a ten.

Cashier:  You gave me a ten.

George:  I'm positive I gave you a twenty.

Cashier:  I know what you gave me.

George:  You owe me ten dollars.

Cashier:  Will you please step aside?  Next?

George:  Alright, let's just examine the situation for a second.  Who, in this
situation, would be more likely to make a mistake?  Me, who had access to my
wallet, knew exactly what was in there?  Or you--

Cashier:  You.

George:  No, no, no, see you're not really listening.

Security Guard:  What's the problem here?

George:  No problem.  There's no problem.  She just owes me ten dollars, that's
all.

Cashier:  He's claiming short.

Security Guard:  Alright, let's just take it outside.

George:  Oh, so you don't believe me either?

Security Guard:  Come on, let's go.

George:  You haven't won.  You may think you've won, but you haven't won.  Do
you know why?  It's not over.  This is not over.  I'm not forgetting what's
happening here.  You have my ten dollars.  I will get it back.  Alright, don't
worry.  It's not over.  I'm going now.  Good bye.  I will be back.


New scene.
George, Elaine and Jerry enter The Party and stand by the door .

Elaine:  Well don't stand here, let's walk in, blend in, blend in.

Jerry:  No, let's survey first.  Camp here.

George (waving):  Eva.

A beautiful woman starts walking over.

Jerry:  What could possess anyone to throw a party?  I mean, to have a bunch of
strangers treat your house like a hotel room.

Ava:  So, guess who just sold 129 West 81st.

George:  Oh no you didn't.  Get out, when?

Ava:  Yesterday

George:  I don't believe it.

Ava:  Ask Mark.

George:  Mark, is this true?

A man across the room nods.  George and Ava walk towards him.

Jerry:  Yeah, this has got disaster written all over it.

Elaine:  How did I ever let you talk me into this, I must have been out of my
mind.

Jerry:  Now listen, let's keep an eye on each other tonight.  In case one of us
gets in a bad conversation, we should have a signal that you're in trouble so
the other one can get us out of it.

Elaine:  How old are you?

Jerry:  Thirty-six.  What's the signal?  Howbout this?  Chicken wing?  No, no,
no, I got a better one.  Head patting.

Elaine:  Whatever you want.


Fast forward a bit, Jerry is sitting on the couch with a stranger.

Guy:  You came all the way out from Manhattan for this?

Jerry:  Yeah, yeah I did.

Guy:  So what do you do?

Jerry (Patting his head):  I'm a comedian.

Guy:  Are you?  Lemme ask you something.  Where do you get your material?

Jerry (still Patting):  I hear a voice.

Guy:  What kind of voice?

Jerry:  A man's voice, but he speaks in German so I have to get a translator.

Guy:  How come you keep tapping your head.

Jerry:  It's a nervous tic.  I'm on L-Dopa.

Cut to Elaine, engaged in a conversation with another guy and patting her head.

Guy:  On the other hand, you take a guy like George Washington Carver.  The man
devoted his whole life to the peanut.  Imagine having so much passion for
something.

Cut back to Jerry and his 'guy'.

Guy:  Ya know, people tell me I'm a funny guy.

Cut back to Elaine and her 'guy'.  She's still tapping madly.

Guy:  I've often wondered if he ever worked with the pecan.

Elaine:  Yeah, me too.

Guy:  Now is that considered a nut, because I know the cashew is a legume.

Cut to George, now talking with Jerry.

George:  How's it going?

Jerry:  Great, how about you?

George:  I can't believe what's happening here.  She hasn't taken her hands off
me all night.  She was always friendly around the office, but that was it.

Jerry:  How do you account for this?

George:  I don't know, maybe a safe fell on her head.

Jerry:  Well, she obviously liked you all along.

George:  No, I would have picked up on it.  I can always tell when a woman likes
me, they always somehow let you know.  With me, they could torture me, I
wouldn't tell them.  If anything I'd try to make them think I don't like them,
then they think, "Oh, look at this guy, he's not even looking at me, he must
have something going for him."

Jerry:  Anyway, I'm ready to go.

George:  Now?

Jerry:  If not now, when?

George:  Gimme a half-hour.

Jerry:  Okay, half-hour.

Cut to Elaine and the 'peanut guy'.  By now, she's weary from tapping.

Guy:  Peanut brittle, peanut butter, peanut oil...

Jerry (interrupting):  Can I talk to you for a second?

Elaine:  Oh, excuse me.  (gets up to talk with Jerry)  What have you been doing,
I've been smacking myself senseless.  People think I'm a mental patient.

Jerry:  Hey, I was dying over there.

Elaine:  This guy's going off on the peanut.  Now pay attention.

Fast forward a bit, a woman (Ellen) is talking to Jerry.

Ellen:  Yeah, I think I've seen you in a club.  You talk about a lot of every
day things, right?

Jerry:  Right.

Ellen:  Yeah, I remember you.

Ellen turns her back and the camera pans out to Elaine, sitting on the couch
near a pretentious woman.

Woman:  I wonder what happened to my fianc.  I know he's here somewhere.
Ellen?  Have you seen my fianc?

Ellen:  He's upstairs.

Woman:  Are you going upstairs?  Tell my fianc I'm looking for him.  I have
lost my fianc, the poor baby.

Elaine:  Maybe the dingo ate your baby.

Woman:  What?

Elaine:  The dingo ate your baby!

Cut to George and Jerry.

Jerry:  You ready?

George:  Listen, I have a tremendous favor to ask.

Jerry:  I do favors.

George:  I think something's happening here.

Jerry:  What?

George:  I think she wants me to take her home.

Jerry:  Wow.

George:  What should I do?

Jerry:  Go!  What could you do?

George:  What about you and Elaine?

Jerry:  We'll get a ride.

George:  Are you sure?

Jerry:  We'll be fine, what did she say?

George:  She told me she wants-- (Pauses until a woman coming down the stairs
passes)  She told me she wants me to make love to her.

Jerry:  What?  She said that?

George:  Yeah.

Jerry:  Get out of here.

George:  I swear.

Jerry:  What did you say?

George:  I, I, I can't.

Jerry:  What did you say?

George:  Please, it's--

Jerry:  What?

George:  I... I... I long for you.

Jerry:  I long for you?

George:  I was so shocked I was lucky I said anything.

Jerry:  It's okay, that's not bad.

George:  I don't like when a woman says, 'Make love to me', it's intimidating.
The last time a woman said that to me, I wound up apologizing to her.

Jerry:  Really?

George:  That's a lot of pressure.  Make love to me.  What am I, in the circus?
What if I can't deliver?

Jerry:  Oh, come on.

George:  I can't perform under pressure.  That's why I never play anything for
money, I choke.  I could choke tonight.  And she works in my office, can you
imagine?  She goes around telling everyone what happened?  Maybe I should
cancel, I have a very bad feeling about this.

Jerry:  George, you're thinking too much.

George:  I know, I know, I can't stop it!

Cut to Elaine, talking with yet another guy on the couch.

Elaine:  Well, right now I'm reading manuscripts for Pendant Publishing.

Jerry (walking up):  Pendant?  Those bastards.

Elaine:  Excuse me.

Jerry:  Listen, George is going home with this Ava from his office

Elaine:  Really?  Huh.  What a world.  So we can go now?

Jerry:  Uh, no, he's taking the car.

Elaine:  Well, what are we gonna do for a ride?

Jerry:  I don't know.

Elaine:  You don't know?

Jerry:  Maybe Kramer can come pick us up.

Elaine:  Oh great, oh, this is great.  How could you let him take the car?

Jerry:  There's nothing I could do, it's part of the code.


Mid-episode monologue

All plans between men are tentative.  If one man should suddenly have an
opportunity to pursue a woman, it's like these two guys never met each other
ever in life.  This is the male code.  And it doesn't matter how important the
arrangements are, I mean, most of the time when they scrub a space shuttle
mission it's because one of the astronauts met someone on his way to the launch
pad.  They hold that countdown.  He's leaning against the rocket talking to her,
"So listen, when I get back what do you say we get together for some Tang?"


Elaine (noticing Ava in a fur):  Oh look at that.  Look at what she's wearing.
You see what she's wearing?

Jerry:  Yeah, yeah, alright.

Elaine:  I can't believe she's walking around in that.

Jerry:  Just don't make a scene.

Elaine:  Hey, is that real fur?

Jerry:  Oh boy.

Eva:  It better be or my ex-husband owes me an explanation.

George:  Yeah, good night.

Elaine:  You don't care that innocent defenseless animals are being tortured so
that you can look good?

George:  Could we talk about this some other time?

Ava:  Are you a vegetarian?

Jerry:  Here we go.

Elaine:  Yeah, I eat fish occasionally.

Ava:  So you're a hypocrite.

George:  Hey, I've eaten frogs, so nobody's perfect.  Anyway-

Ava:  Well, talk to me when you stop eating fish.

Elaine:  Fish don't feel any pain.

Ava:  How do you know?  Do you communicate with fish?

Elaine:  Well, they're not kept in little cages.

Ava:  Ever seen a goldfish?

George:  Goldfish.

Elaine:  Yeah, yeah I've seen goldfish.  They're not unhappy.

Ava:  Oh yeah, right.  Swim around in a bowl for two weeks and get flushed down
the toilet, that's a good life.  (To George)  Let's go.

Elaine:  Oh yeah, that's right.  Go ahead, go ahead, maybe you can run over a
squirrel!

George:  That's why we're here in America.

Jerry:  You're beautiful.

Elaine:  Call Kramer.

Jerry:  Alright. (Approaches host)  Excuse me, this is your party, right?

Steve:  No, I just live here.

Jerry:  Can I use your phone?

Steve:  What's in it for me?

Jerry:  A bigger bill?

Steve:  He he, go for it.

Jerry picks up the phone and dials.

Jerry:  Krame?  Sein.  What are you doing?  Well, I'm stuck out here on Long
Island.  What are your thoughts about taking a ride?  You sure?  Okay, but don't
leave me hanging here.  Okay, great.  Let me give you directions.

Cut to several hours later.  The party has ended.  The hosts, Steve and Jenny,
are cleaning up, Elaine and Jerry are still there.

Elaine:  You sure you don't need any help?

Jenny:  No, not really.

Jerry:  I'm sure he'll be here any minute.

Jenny (To Steve):  I want them out of here.

Elaine:  Call him again.

Jerry:  I called, what should I do? (To Jenny) We really appreciate this.

Jenny (To Steve):  It's two o'clock in the morning.

Jerry (noticing a coffee table book):  Oh, you got the Civil War book.  I saw
some of that show, it was wonderful.

Elaine:  Six hundred and twenty million people died.

Jerry:  Thousand.

Elaine:  Thousand.  Six hundred and twenty thousand.  The horror, the horror.
(To Jerry)  The wife keeps giving us dirty looks.  Are you sure you gave him the
right directions?

Jerry:  Yes.  (To Jenny)  You're sure there's nothing we can do?

Jenny:  No!  (To Steve)  I am not going to bed with them in out house, this is
ridiculous.

Jerry:  You know a friend of my father's used to live right around here.  Mike
Wichter.  He sold plastic straws.  You know the ones?  You could bend them.

Elaine:  Have you noticed, people don't use straws as much as they used to for
some reason.

Jenny:  You know, it doesn't look as if your friend is coming.

Jerry:  Oh, he's coming.

Jenny:  Maybe you should take a look at a train schedule.

Jenny sees a figure outside the kitchen window and screams.

Jerry:  That's him.

Jenny:  I'm going to bed!

Elaine:  Thanks a lot.

Jerry:  Thanks, great party.

As Jenny storms up the stairs there's a knock at the door, Steve answers.

Kramer:  Hey, how ya doing?

Steve:  Ah, look who's here.

Kramer:  I'm sorry.

Jerry:  Hey, it's okay.

Kramer:  I had the directions on the seat right next to me, they flew out the
window.

Elaine:  Then how did you find the place?

Kramer:  Well I knew the exit on the Long Island Expressway, and I thought that
the address was 8713 Riviera Drive.  Uh uh, so I drove around knocking on
everybody's doors that had those numbers; 8317, 7813, 3718, 1837, whoo.
Finally, I hit it.  8173.

Jerry:  Anyway, thanks a lot for letting us stay here, Steve, I really owe you
one.

Steve:  No problem.

Jerry:  And if you're ever in the city, you know, you want to come to a comedy
club, whatever.

Steve:  Hey, I might take you up on that.

Jerry (writing):  Here's my address and number.  And really, thanks again.

Kramer (to Elaine):  You better zip up.  I couldn't get the top on the
convertible up.

Elaine:  But it's cold out.

Kramer:  Yeah, wait till we get on the Expressway.


New scene.
Jerry's at his apartment, talking on the phone.

Jerry:  George, I've been sick all week.  Elaine was too.  Eighty miles an hour,
forty degree temperature for fifty minutes.  Do the math.  Yeah, maybe I will
get out.  Hey, let me just stop off at the drug store first.  Okay, meet me down
there in fifteen minutes then we'll go do something.  Yeah, Selwyn's.  Okay bye.

Jerry hangs up and grabs his coat and there's a knock at the door.

Jerry:  Who is it?

Voice:  Mr. Pocatello.

Jerry:  Who?

Voice:  You mean you don't recognize my voice?

Jerry opens the door.  Steve steps in.

Steve:  Jerry, baby!

Jerry:  Do I know you?

Steve:  Boy this comedy's really frying your brain.

Jerry:  I'm sorry, uh-

Steve:  See, this is the kind of lasting impression I make on people.

Jerry:  Oh, okay.

Steve:  You said if I was ever in the city, I'm in the city.

Jerry:  You certainly are.  What's going on?

Steve:  I'm just waiting for a lift back to the island, he won't be ready until
eleven, so I figured I'd give you a break.  I thought I'd see what it was like
to hang out with someone in show business.

Jerry:  Listen, I'm really sorry but I'm just on my way out to meet a friend.

Steve:  Oh, come on, you can come up with something better than that.

Jerry:  No, really, I just got off the phone with him.

Steve:  I understand.

Jerry:  Look, you can hang out here if you want.

Steve:  Don't be so enthusiastic.

Jerry:  No, it's-

Steve:  I'm not gonna steal anything.

Jerry:  No, of course not, just close the door when you leave.

Steve:  I think I can do that.

Jerry:  Really, I'm sorry.  Maybe another time.

Steve:  Yeah.  Let's have lunch.


New scene.
Jerry and George are at the drug store.

Jerry:  They guy's in my house right now.  What a mistake that party was, I
never should have gone.

George:  Yeah, me either.

Jerry:  Oh, come on.

George:  What come on?  Have you ever dated a woman that worked in your office?

Jerry:  I've never had a job.

George:  You know the anxiety you feel on a date?  That's what I have every day
now.  My worst nightmare's come true, every day is a date.

Jerry:  That's one of Dante's nine stages of hell, isn't it?

George:  Ava was one of the reasons I used to like going to work, she was a
friend.  Now we sleep together and suddenly, I don't know how to talk to her.
Every time I go to the bathroom I pass her desk.  I have to plan little patter.
I spend half my day writing.  Then afterwards, I sit in my office and analyze
how it went.  If it was a good conversation, I don't go to the bathroom for the
rest of the day.  I see her laughing and talking with other people, they're all
so loose and relaxed, I think, 'that used to be me.  I want to go back there
again.'

Jerry:  What are you gonna do?

George:  I have no choice, I'm quitting.


Cut back to Steve sitting alone on Jerry's couch watching TV.  Kramer walks in
and it takes a moment for him to recognize the visitor.

Kramer:  The party, Long Island?

Steve:  Kramer, right?

Kramer:  Hey, what are you doing here?

Steve:  I'm waiting for my ride.

Kramer:  Where's Jerry?

Steve:  He split.  Let me ask you something.  Is there anything to drink in here
or is that, like, a stupid question?

Kramer:  Well, Jerry, he doesn't have anything.  (Sensing Steve's
disappointment)  Well, but I might have something.

Cut back to Jerry and George at the drugstore.  Jerry is selecting medication.

Jerry:  Alright, I'm gonna get this.  This looks good.

George:  How much is that?

Jerry:  Nine sixty.

George:  Nine sixty?  Give it to me.

Jerry:  Why?

George:  Don't worry, I got it.

Jerry:  What do you mean, you got it?

George:  I got it.

George takes the box and begins to place it in his jacket.

Jerry:  Since when are you treating me to medicine?  What are you doing?  You're
stealing this, aren't you?

George:  I'm not stealing it.  They owe me ten dollars.  They stole from me.

Jerry:  You're a lunatic.

George:  I have to do this, it's a matter of honor.

Jerry:  What do you say to a person like you?

George:  Just walk.

Jerry:  Oh.

A security guard approaches George.

Security Guard:  Scuse me.  What do you got there?

George:  What?

Security Guard:  What do you got in your shirt?

George:  Oh, I was gonna pay for this.

Security Guard (grabbing George by the elbow and walking him to the counter):
Come with me.

George (nervous):  Where are you taking me?  I was gonna pay for it.

Cashier: um-hmm.

Security Guard:  You don't think I remember you?

George (more nervous):  What are you talking about?

Security Guard:  I know who you are, I was watching you.

George (panicky):  What are you gonna do?  Are you gonna call the police?

The Security Guard drags George away and Jerry steps to the counter.

Jerry:  Can I still buy this or is this evidence now?

Cut back to Kramer and Steve, they're obviously tanked.  Kramer is in the middle
of a story.

Kramer:  So, I'm chasing these doves down the street and she's screaming at the
top of her lungs, and then when the magician comes back from Europe, two of them
turned brown!  Well I followed the instructions!

They both erupt in raucous laughter.

Steve (hysterical):  Ah, they turned brown!!  Brown!! (the laughter winds down)
So let me ask you something, you know any women we could call?

Kramer:  Not really.

Steve:  Maybe we should call one of those escort services.  I saw one of them
advertised before on the cable station.

Kramer (handing Steve the phone)  555-LOVE.

Steve:  Hey, you want in on this?

Kramer:  No, I got a girl in the next building


New scene.
Jerry is outside his apartment door, as he puts in the key, he hears a woman's
voice from inside.

Voice:  Now I want my money, mister, and I ain't leaving until I get it.  Now I
am through playing games with you, I got things to do.

Steve (drunk and slurring):  Oh Jerry!  Jerry!  Look who's here, it's Jerry

Jerry:  What the hell?

Steve:  Jerry, this is Patti.

Jerry:  Nice to meet you.

Patti:  It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, I'm sure.

Jerry:  What the hell is going on here?

Steve:  I don't know, but I gotta do this more often.  (The buzzer goes off)
Ooh, there's my ride, finally.

Patti:  I'm not gonna go anywhere until I get the rest of my money.

Steve:  See ya, Jerr.  And tell Kramer thanks and I'll call him tomorrow.

Jerry:  Oh, Kramer huh?

Steve:  Yeah, he's a hoot.  Oh, goodbye, my dear.  (trying to kiss Patti's hand
as she pulls it away)  Ouch.  (To Jerry)  Weekend of the 26th, come on out,
we're having another party.

Steve walks out, leaving the front door open.

Patti:  I ain't leaving.

Jerry:  Patti?

Patti:  You got anything to drink?

Jerry:  Alright, how much does he owe you?

Patti:  Fifty dollars.

Jerry (taking out his wallet and handing over bills grudgingly):  Fifty dollars.

In mid-payment, a police officer walks through the open door.

Cop:  This your apartment?

Jerry:  Yeah, but--

Cop:  You're under arrest for solicitation of prostitution.

Jerry:  Wait a second, I--

Elaine walks in.

Elaine:  I brought you chicken soup.  (To Patti)  Is that real fur?

Jerry (and the cop, in unison):  Oh boy.


New scene.
Jerry and George are at Jerry's apartment, watching TV and eating pizza.

George:  You had Sgt. Chadway?  Me too.

Jerry:  He was a nice guy.

George:  Oh, great guy.

Jerry:  Was there a red-headed guy there?

George:  The one with the long sideburns?

Jerry:  Yeah.

George:  Where does he come off?

Jerry:  Yeah, I know.  There's no call for that kind of attitude.

George:  One of the guys in my cell threw a piece of gum at him.

Jerry:  Oh, we all hated him.


Closing monologue.

There's two types of favors, the big favor and the small favor.  You can measure
the size of the favor by the pause that a person takes after they ask you to 'do
me a favor.'  Small favor, small pause.  Can you do me a favor, hand me that
pencil?  No pause at all.  Big favors are, 'Could you do me a favor...' (huge
pause, followed by closing credits.)


Opening monologue.
Seems to me the way they design the car alarm is so that the car will behave as
if it was a nervous hysterical person. Anyone goes near it, anyone disturbs it,
it's aaaaaahhhhhhh! Lights flashing on and off, acting all crazy. Not
everybody wants to draw that much attention to themselves, wouldn't it be nice
if you could have a car alarm that was a little more subtle? You know, somebody
tries to break in, it goes, "Ahem. Ahem. Excuse me?" I would like a car alarm
like that.


First scene.
Jerry and George are entering Jerry's apartment.

Jerry: Do you believe this? The car was parked right out front.

George: Was the alarm on?

Jerry: I don't know, I guess it was on. I don't know my alarm sound; I'm not
tuned in to it like it's my son.

George: I don't understand, how do these thieves start the car?

Jerry: They cross the wires or something.

George: Cross the wires? I can't even make a pot of spaghetti.

Kramer enters.

Jerry: They stole my car.

Kramer: Who did?

Jerry: They did.

Kramer: Was it more than just one?

Jerry: What should I do, should I call the police?

Kramer: What are they gonna do?

Jerry: I'd better call the car phone company, cancel my service.

George: Maybe you should call your car phone.

Jerry: Yeah, he's probably driving it right now.

George: Wait a minute, call the car phone, see what happens.

Jerry: Are you serious?

George: Yeah, go ahead, call.

Jerry: I don't even know if I remember the number.

Jerry dials.

Jerry: What do I say if he picks up?

Car thief: Hello?

Jerry: Hello? Is this 555-8383?

Car thief: I have no idea.

Jerry: Can I ask you a question?

Car thief: Sure.

Jerry: Did you steal my car?

Car thief: Yes I did.

Jerry: You did?!

Car thief: I did.

Jerry: That's my car!

Car thief: I didn't know it was yours.

Jerry: What are you gonna do with it?

Car thief: I dunno, drive around.

Jerry: Then can I have it back?

Car thief: Mmmm, nah, I'm gonna keep it.

Kramer gestures for Jerry to hand him the phone.

Kramer: Hello?

Car thief: Yeah, who's this?

Kramer: Kramer.

Car thief: Hello, Kramer.

Kramer: Listen, there's a pair of gloves in the glove compartment.

Car thief: Wait, hold on... Brown ones?

Kramer: Yeah. Listen, could you mail those to me? Or bring them by my
building, it's 129 West 81st St.

Car thief: One-two-nine, okay.

Kramer: Thanks a lot, uh here's Jerry.

Jerry (derisively at Kramer): Gloves. (Into the phone) Hello?

Car thief: Jerry?

Jerry: Yeah, let me ask you a question. How do you cross those wires?

Car thief: I didn't cross any wires, the keys were in it.

Jerry: Sid left the keys in the car. Alright, I gotta go. Drive carefully.

Car thief: Jerry, when's the last time you had a tune-up? Because I can't find
the--

Jerry hangs up.

Jerry: Sid left the keys in the car.

George: Who's Sid?

Jerry: He's this guy in the neighborhood, parks cars on the block.

George: What do you mean?

Jerry: He moves them from one side of the street to the other so you don't get
a ticket.

George: What, do you pay him for that?

Jerry: Yeah, like fifty bucks a month.

George: How many people does he do that for?

Jerry: The whole block, forty, fifty cars.

Kramer: He only works three hours a day. He makes a fortune. Course he's been
doing that for years, right Jerry?

George: Could anybody do that?

Sid enters.

Jerry: Hey Sid, what happened?

Sid: I'm sorry, Jerry. Maybe I'm getting too old for this stuff.

Jerry: You left the keys in the car?

Sid: Well, you know they're making that Woody Allen movie in the block, and all
those people and trucks everywhere, when I saw him I must have got a little
distracted.

Kramer: You know I'm in that movie?

George: You are?

Kramer: Yeah, I'm an extra.

George: How'd you get that?

Kramer: Well, I was just watching them film yesterday and some guy just asked
me.

George: Right out of the clear blue sky?

Kramer: Clear blue sky!

George: Well, why didn't they ask me?

Kramer: I got a quality.

Sid: Jerry, you got insurance, right?

Jerry: Yeah, but no car. I'll have to rent one.

Sid: Well I'm going down to visit my sister in Virginia next Wednesday, for a
week, so I can't park it.

Jerry: This Wednesday?

Sid: No, next Wednesday, week after this Wednesday.

Jerry: But the Wednesday two days from now is the next Wednesday.

Sid: If I meant this Wednesday, I would have said this Wednesday. It's the
week after this Wednesday.

George: Sid, who's gonna move the cars while you're away?

Sid: Whoever wants to move them, why do I care who moves them? They can move
themselves if they want.

George: Maybe I could move them until you get back.

Sid: What's a young man like you want to move cars for? You don't work?

George: I'm in a transition phase right now.

Sid: Well if you want to move the cars, move the cars. Just don't forget to
take the keys out, that's all.

Phone rings.

Jerry: Hello? Yeah, the defroster's the one on the bottom, just slide it all
the way over. You're welcome.


New scene.
Jerry and Elaine are in line at the rental car agency.

Elaine: I'm in awe of his intellect, when he talks it sounds like he's reading
from one of his novels.

Jerry: Owen March, I never heard of him.

Elaine: Well, he's not a baseball player.

Jerry: Yeah, that's true. Well it sounds like it's going pretty good.

Elaine: Yeah. Well, there is one little problem.

Jerry: What's that?

Elaine: He's sixty-six years old.

Rental car agent: Next please.

Elaine: Well, go, go.

Agent: Can I help you? Name please?

Jerry: Seinfeld. I made a reservation for a mid-size, and she's a small. I'm
kidding around, of course.

Agent: Okay, let's see here.

Jerry: Sixty-six years old?

Elaine: Yeah, well, he's in perfect health. He works out, he's vibrant. You'd
really like him.

Jerry: Why do people always say that? I hate everyone, why would I like him?

Elaine: What do you think, would you go out with a sixty-six year old woman?

Jerry: Well, I'll tell you, she would have to be really vibrant. So vibrant,
she'd be spinning.

Agent: I'm sorry, we have no mid-size available at the moment.

Jerry: I don't understand, I made a reservation, do you have my reservation?

Agent: Yes, we do, unfortunately we ran out of cars.

Jerry: But the reservation keeps the car here. That's why you have the
reservation.

Agent: I know why we have reservations.

Jerry: I don't think you do. If you did, I'd have a car. See, you know how to
take the reservation, you just don't know how to *hold* the reservation and
that's really the most important part of the reservation, the holding. Anybody
can just take them.

Agent: Let me, uh, speak with my supervisor.

The agent goes into an office with a window in the door so she can be seen
speaking with someone.

Jerry: Uh, here we go. The supervisor. You know what she's saying over there?

Elaine: What?

Jerry: Hey Marge, you see those two people over there? They think I'm talking
to you, so you pretend like you're talking to me, okay now you start talking.

Elaine: Oh, you mean like this? So it looks like I'm saying something but I'm
not really saying anything at all?

Jerry: Now you say something else and they won't yell at me 'cause they thought
I was checking with you.

Elaine: Okay, that's it. I think that's enough, see you later.

The agent returns.

Agent: I'm sorry, my supervisor says there's nothing we can do.

Jerry: Yeah, it looked as if you were in a real conversation over there.

Agent: But we do have a compact if you would like that.

Jerry: Fine.

Agent: Alright. We have a blue Ford Escort for you Mr. Seinfeld. Would you
like insurance?

Jerry: Yeah, you better give me the insurance, because I am gonna beat the hell
out of this car.

Agent: Please fill this out.

Elaine: What do you think, you think I'm making a big mistake?

Jerry: Hey, if you enjoy being with him, that's what's important.

Elaine: I love being with him. I mean, I like being with him. It's okay being
with him.


New scene.
Elaine and Jerry are at Jerry's apartment.

Elaine: I just don't enjoy being with him.

Jerry: Well that's what's important.

Elaine: I'm meeting him for lunch at Chadway's around the corner, do I have to
break up with him face to face or can I just wait and do it over the phone?

Jerry: How many times you been out with him?

Elaine: Seven?

Jerry: Face to face.

Elaine: Seven dates is a face-to-face break up?

Jerry: If it was six I could have let you go, but seven, I'm afraid, is over
the limit. Unless, of course, there was no sex.

Elaine: Hmm... How's the pasta over there?

Kramer enters, as he's walking in, George rushes in, pushes him out of the way
and heads for the kitchen sink.

Kramer: Whoa, whoa!!

Jerry: What is going on out there?

George: I need like a bucket of water! I got a car overheating, I got an alarm
that won't go off, I'm pressing 'one', I'm pressing 'two', nothing! What do I
do?! Help me! Help me!

George runs off into the bathroom.

Kramer: Hey, you know they were supposed to do my scene today?

Elaine: Today?!

Kramer: You know they told me that they wanted me to walk down the block
carrying this bag of groceries.

Elaine: Yeah.

Kramer: So I start to walk, and I trip, and the grocery bag goes flying, and
Woody, Woody starts laughing.

Elaine: He was laughing?!

Kramer: Oh yeah, he was drinking something, it started to come out of his nose.

Jerry: So then what?

Kramer: I got a line in the movie!

Elaine: Get out!

Jerry: That's great!

George: You got a line in the Woody Allen movie?

Kramer: Pretty good, huh?

George: You're in the movie? Is he in the scene?

Kramer: Oh yeah, yeah, it's me and him. I might have a whole new career on my
hands, huh?

Jerry: You mean *a* career.

Elaine: So was Mia Farrow there?

Kramer: Uh, I didn't see him.

Elaine: What's your line?

Kramer: Oh, well uh, okay I'm there with, uh, Woody, you know, I'm at this bar
and, uh, I'm sit-- you know it's Woody Allen, did I mention that?

The other three impatiently encourage Kramer to continue.

Kramer: So I'm sitting there with Woody and I say, I turn to him and I go,
"Boy, these pretzels are making me thirsty."

George: Is that how you're gonna say it?

Kramer: No, no, I'm working on it.

Elaine: Do it like this. "These pretzels are making me thirsty."

Jerry: No. "These pretzels are making me thirsty."

Kramer: No, no. See, that's no good. See, you don't know how to act.

George: "These pretzels are making me thirsty!!"

Jerry pinches his nose.

George: That was no good?

Kramer: I didn't say anything.

Elaine: I'm gonna go break up with Owen.

George: What was wrong with that? I had a different interpretation! Do you
know anything about this pretzel guy?! Maybe he's been in the bar a really long
time and he's really depressed because he has no job and no woman and he's
parking cars for a living! (out the window to honking cars) Alright! Alright!
Shut up! Shut up! I hear you! I'm coming down! These pretzels are making me
thirsty!

George storms out.


New scene.
Still Jerry's apartment, some time later. There's a pounding on the door, Jerry
opens it and Elaine enters with an unconscious older man.

Jerry: Oh my god.

Elaine: Call an ambulance.

Jerry: Boy, he took it hard.


New scene.
Owen is now lying on Jerry's couch and Elaine is explaining what happened.

Elaine: We were walking down the block right by your house and I was just about
to break up with him then all of a sudden he started to twitch.

Jerry (on the phone): Hello? Yes, I need an ambulance at one twenty nine west
Eighty-first Street, apartment five-A.

Elaine: Tell then to hurry! Hurry!

Jerry (To Elaine): It's an ambulance. (To the operator) I don't know but he's
unconscious.

Kramer enters.

Kramer: These pretzels are making me thirsty. (He bites into a pretzel.) Boy,
these pretzels are making me thirsty.

Jerry: Kramer.

Kramer: What happened here?

Elaine: I don't know, I don't know, what should we do? We called an ambulance,
does anyone know first aid?

Jerry: Shouldn't you do something with the extremities?

Elaine: What extremities?

Kramer: What's an extremity?

Jerry: You raise the feet, get blood to the head.

Kramer: You raise the head, you get blood to the feet.

Elaine: Okay, what about a cold compress? They always do that.

Jerry: I don't have a washcloth.

Elaine: Well use a paper towel.

Jerry: You can't put a paper towel on his head.

Kramer: What about a big sponge?

Jerry: How you gonna hold it on there?

Kramer: Use a belt.

Elaine: No no no no no, that'll, it'll drip all over him.

Jerry: Should we walk him around?

Elaine and Kramer (at the same time): Yes, yes.

Kramer: Yeah, I've seen them do that.

Jerry: No, no that's for a drug overdose.

Kramer: Maybe that's what he's got.

Elaine: No no no no, Kramer, I just had lunch with him, he didn't leave the
table.

Kramer: Well he could have dropped acid when you weren't looking.

Elaine: He is not a drug addict!

Jerry: Hey, you know what? Maybe he's a diabetic, he might just need a cookie
or something.

Elaine: A cookie!

Kramer: Can you give him a cookie?

Elaine: How's he gonna chew it?

Jerry: We'll move his teeth, it happened to my uncle, the sugar revived him.

Kramer puts a cookie into Owen's mouth and starts working his jaw up and down.

Elaine: Careful, you're getting crumbs all over him.

Kramer: I got him chewing but I don't think he's gonna swallow.

Elaine: You know what, let's put a few cookies in a blender and he could drink
it.

Jerry: Cookies don't liquefy.

Elaine: Yes they do, you can liquefy a cookie.

Kramer: Alright I'll get a blender.

Jerry: What blender? I don't have a blender.

Kramer: You got a blender.

Jerry: I would know if I had a blender.

Elaine: Where is the ambulance?!

Just then a siren can be heard followed by a skidding sound followed by a
crashing sound.

The frame dissolves out and in as if to show time passing.

Jerry (on phone): Hello, yes, I called for an ambulance like thirty-five
minutes ago.

Elaine: I can't believe what's going on out here.

Jerry: This is an emergency, what's taking so long? (the door buzzer buzzes)
Wait a second, maybe that's them. (presses button) Hello?

Voice: Paramedics.

Jerry: Come on up. Okay, they're here.

Elaine: He seems to be breathing.

Jerry: Ya know, I gotta tell you, he's a pretty good-looking guy.

Elaine: I know.

Jerry: Those eyebrows could use a trimming, you ever mention that to him?

Elaine: Almost.

Jerry: Hey, look at this, c'mon, running wild there.

Elaine: It's not an easy thing to bring up.

Jerry: Yeah, that's true.

Elaine: Aw, you should see his bathrobe, man, it's all silk.

Jerry: Yeah? Does he wear slippers? I bet he wears slippers.

Elaine: He does, how'd you know that?

Jerry: I could tell.

Two paramedics enter with a stretcher.

Elaine: What happened, what took you so long?!

Paramedic: We got here twenty minutes ago but we couldn't move, the whole
intersection is gridlocked, I've never seen anything like it. So finally we
make the turn and this guy who's running around triple-parking cars slammed into
us with a blue Escort.

Jerry: Blue Escort? That's my rent-a-car!

George enters, blotting his forehead with a washcloth.

George: Oh man.

Jerry: What happened to the car?

George: Sorry, you don't know what's going on out there! (looks at Owen)
Who's he?

Elaine: This guy I'm seeing.

George: What happened?

Jerry: We don't know!

Paramedic: Who put cookies in his mouth?

Jerry and Elaine: Cookies?

Paramedic: You're not supposed to do that.

Jerry: So how'd you hit the car?

George: I was moving it across the street, I looked up and I saw Woody Allen
and I got all distracted.

Jerry: It's not even my car, it's a rental.

Kramer enters.

Kramer: What are you doing out there?! You're holding up the production of the
movie! We can't shoot and Woody, he's really mad at you.

George: Woody mentioned me? What did he say?

Kramer: He said, 'Who's the moron in the blue jacket who's got the street all
screwed up?'

George: Should I apologize to Woody?

Kramer: Alright, I'll tell you what. Next time I talk to him, maybe I'll bring
it up. I'll feel him out.


Mid-episode Monologue.
What do you think first aid was like though, like hundreds of years ago? You
know, I mean they had no medicine, no drugs, no technology, no equipment.
Basically, they were there first. That was it, that was the whole first aid.
They sit with you. That's all they could do. 'Can you help me?' 'No, no we
can't help you, we were the first ones here, I don't know if you know that. Did
you see out truck? First aid, that's our motto. We show up before anybody.'


New scene.
Jerry, George and Sid are in Jerry's apartment.

Sid: Now you didn't tell me you didn't know how to drive. You should have
mentioned that.

George: Well I know how to drive.

Sid: Then how'd all those cars get damaged? Why are people calling me up
screaming on the phone? Most of them cancelled out on me.

Jerry: Can I get anybody anything?

Sid: Moving cars from one side of the street to the other don't take no more
sense than putting on a pair of pants. My question to you is who's putting your
pants on?

George: I put my pants on, Sid.

Sid: I don't believe you. If you can put your pants on, you can move those
cars.

George: Well I don't want to get into a big dispute about the pants.

Sid: Who's gonna send money to my sister in Virginia? Her little boy needs
surgery on his foot. Now he'll be walking around with a limp because you can't
park a few cars.

George: Maybe I could call my father.

Kramer enters holding a newspaper.

Kramer: Hey, you seen the paper yet?

Jerry: Interestingly enough, no, inasmuch as it is my paper.

Kramer: Yeah. There's an article in there about that writer.

Jerry (reading) Owen March, prominent author and essayist suffered a stroke
yesterday in the upper West Side apartment of a friend.

Kramer: Uh huh, that's the guy that was here. You're the friend.

Jerry (continuing): The extent of the damage would have been far less severe
had paramedics been able to reach him sooner.

Sid: Oh lord.

Jerry (finishing): The commotion also delayed production of a Woody Allen movie
that was shooting up the block. A spokeswoman for the legendary filmmaker said
that Mr. Allen was extremely agitated and wondered if his days of shooting
movies in New York were over.


New scene.
Elaine and Jerry are back at the car rental agency, Jerry's eating a bag of
pretzels.

Elaine: Five seconds. Jerry, I was five seconds away from breaking up with
him. Five seconds. The next words out of my mouth were, 'Owen, it's over.'

Jerry: Can he communicate?

Elaine: Yeah, well, he nods. And I think he understands me, he seems to enjoy
it when I read to him.

Jerry: Alright, she's free. (Steps up to the counter) Hi, I called before,
uh, my car got smashed.

Elaine: So listen, what should I do? I mean if I break up with him now it'll
look like I'm abandoning him because of his condition, I'll be ostracized from
the community.

Jerry: What community? There's a community?

Elaine: Of course there's a community.

Jerry: All these years I'm living in a community, I had no idea.

Agent: Sir the estimate on the damage to your car is two thousand eight hundred
and sixty-six dollars.

Jerry: Hmm, well, I got the insurance and everything so...

Agent: Yes, now, uh, in your report you said that you were not the driver of
the car at the time of the accident.

Jerry: That is right, somebody else was driving.

Agent: Alright, well, sir, you're only covered for when you're driving the car.

Jerry: Uh huh, what's that?

Agent: You're not covered for other drivers.

Jerry: Other drivers?

Agent: Um hm.

Jerry: Your whole business is based on other drivers. It's a rented car.
That's who's driving it, other drivers. Doesn't my credit card cover me or
something?

Agent: Not that particular one.

Jerry: Well I got a hundred cards, here, pick a card, take a card, any card you
want, go ahead, whichever one, I don't care.

Agent: Sir, if you had read the rental agreement--

Jerry: Did you see the size of that document? It's like the Declaration of
Independence, who's gonna read that?

Agent: Mr. Seinfeld, as it stands right now, you are not covered for that
damage and there is absolutely nothing that can be done about that.

Jerry: These pretzels are making me thirsty.


New scene.
Elaine and Owen are at Owen's apartment, Owen is in a wheelchair and in
generally unresponsive as Elaine feeds him soup.

Elaine: Ahh, it's good, isn't it? Yankee Bean. Why Yankee Bean, huh? Don't
they have beans in the south? I mean if you order Yankee Bean in the south, are
they offended? Huh? (singing) Yankee Bean, Yankee Bean, I like my Yankee
Bean. (she puts the bowl down and wipes Owen's mouth with a napkin) Owen, I
think we have to talk. I mean, uh, *I* have to talk. It would be nice if *we*
could, but, uh, whatever. Um, don't get me wrong, I like coming here, and uh,
feeding you and cleaning a little, and paying your bills, that's good stuff.
Good stuff! I have a wonderful time when I'm with you, wonderful! But at this
point in my life, I'm not really sure that I'm ready to make a commitment to one
person. I'm just not really sure that we have enough in common. For example, I
like running in the park, bicycling, roller skating, tennis and skiing, and um,
well, I'm gonna be brutally honest with you now, Owen, it's a bitch to get here.
It's two subways. I have to transfer at Forty-second Street to take the
double-R. Anyway, I mean, this doesn't mean we can't be friends. These
pretzels are making me thirsty.


New scene.
Coffee shop. Elaine, Jerry and George are at their usual booth.

Elaine: Can you die from an odor? I mean, like if you were locked in a
vomitorium for two weeks, could you actually die from the odor?

Jerry: An overdose of odor? Good question.

George: Do I smell?

Elaine: No no no no, I was just down on the forty-second street subway today,
it is disgusting. Guess who I bumped into. Owen.

Jerry: Ahh.

George: He's alright?

Elaine: Yeah, he's almost fully recovered. He told me he was just using me for
sex.

The waitress brings the check.

Jerry: Let me get that.

George: No no no, I got it.

Jerry: Please.

George: No come on, let me, let me. I smashed your car, it cost you over two
thousand dollars,

Jerry: Yeah, a cup of coffee should cover it.

Kramer enters and sits down.

Jerry: What are you doing here?

Kramer: I got fired from the movie.

George: Get out of here, why?

Kramer: Well, you know they were gonna shoot it today, and uh, we rehearsed it
twice, then Woody yells 'Action!' and I turn to him and I say, 'These pretzels
are making me thirsty' and I took a swig of beer, ya know, and I slammed the
glass down on the bar and it shattered.

Elaine: Aww.

Kramer: Well, one of the pieces must have hit Woody. He started crying. And
he yells out, 'I'm bleeding' and he runs off. Anyway, this woman, she came up
to me and she says, 'You're fired.' Boy I really nailed that scene.

Kramer drops a pair of gloves on the table. Jerry picks up the gloves.

Jerry: Aw, wait a--. Oh. Oh, for crying out loud.


Closing monologue.

I think the best part of a relationship is when you're sick. And the best part
of being sick is when you're in a relationship. And if I was to get married,
you know all those vows; for richer or for poorer, for better or for worse, all
I need is the sickness. That, to me, is the most important one. Do you take
this man in sickness? That's the only time I need somebody there. Rest of the
time, go out, have a ball, do whatever you want, but if I get the sniffles, you
better be there.

End.

At the comedy club

Jerry: I'm sorry it's gotta be a little bit of a scary place to work. I don't know how you feel about it. You want to be standing there having people comming in all day going "I need knives. I need more knives. Do you have any bigger knives? I'd like a bigger knife, a big, long, sharp knife, that's what I'm in the market for. I like them really sharp. Do you have one with hooks and gouges like blades and kind of serrated? That's the kind of knife I'm looking for. I need one I can throw. I need another one I can just hack away with. Do you have anything like that?

(Commercial)

At a party

Jerry: Oh yeah, like you know what you're talking about.

George: Like you do.

Jerry: Well what do you think? They put the statue on a giant raft and a tugboat pulled it all the way from France?

George: What do you think? The brought it over in pieces and screwed it together like a coffee table?

Jerry: I don't know. It's too early for a Christmas party isn't it?

George: Why did France give that to us anyway?

Jerry: It was a gift.

George: So countries just exchange gifts like that?

Jerry: If they like each other.

George: There's Elaine.

Jerry: See that guy he's talking with? That's her new boyfriend.

George: Really? They work here in the office?

Jerry: Yeah. They're having a little fling so don't say anything.

George: Who am I going to tell? My mother? Like I've got nothing better to talk about.

Jerry: You don't. He's a recovering alcoholic.

George: Really?

Jerry: Yeah. He's been off the wagon for two years.

George: "Off the wagon"?

Jerry: I think it's off the wagon.

George: I think it's "on the wagon".

Elaine: Jerry, George, what are you doing here?

Jerry: What am I doing here? Ba-boom (holding out a present)

Elaine: *gasp* My god! My watch! You found my watch! (pushing Jerry)

Jerry: Hey keep your hands to yourself if you know what's good for you.

Elaine: Where did you find it?

Jerry: Under the sofa cushion.

Elaine: And you stopped by just to give it to me?

Jerry: It's your Christmas present.

Elaine: I though I'd never find it.

George: Well today's your lucky day.

Elaine: No. Today's *your* lucky day.

George: It will be my first one.

Elaine: You want to work here?

George: Huh?

Elaine: Yeah one of the readers left and there's a job opening. Dick, this is Jerry and this is George.

Dick: Hi nice to meet you. Is this the guy?

Jerry: "The guy?"

Elaine: (softly to Dick) Dick.

George: How can you just get it?

Elaine: My boss told me to find someone. I'm in charge of it. All you have to do is meet him. Come on. Come on, come on, here hold my drink.

Jerry: Cranberry juice?

Elaine: And vodka.

Dick: I got the cranberry juice.

Dick: So... you're Jerry.

Jerry: So... I'm Jerry. (he puts down the drink)

Boss (What is his name?): So have you ever done this kind of work before?

George: Well, you know, book reports. That kind of stuff.

Boss: How do you read?

George: I like Mike Lubika.

Boss: Mike Lubika?

George: He's a sports writer for the daily news. I find him very insightful...

Boss: No, no, no. I mean authors.

George: Lot of good ones. I don't even want to mention anyone because I'm afraid I'm going to leave somebody out.

Boss: Name a couple.

George: Who do I like? I, like, uh, Art, Vandelay.

Boss: Art Vandelay?

George: He's an obscure writer. Betnik, on the village.

Boss: What has he written?

George: Venetian Blinds.

Dick: (picking up the drink) I've got new for you. I'm funnier than you are.

Jerry: Why don't get we together New Years day and watch some football.

Elaine: Where's my drink?

Jerry: There. (turns to George) So, how did it go?

George: I think he was impressed.

Elaine: No, no, no, this is just cranberry juice.

Jerry: Oh, uh, I think maybe Dick picked up yours.

Elaine: Dick? He can't drink. He's an alcoholic. I told you to hold it.

Jerry: I didn't know you meant *hold* it, I thought you meant hold it.

Elaine: One drink like that and he could fall right off the wagon.

George: Told you.

At a clothing store.

Jerry: I never feel comfortable in the women's department. I feel like I'm just a *little* too close to trying on a dress.

George: Do I really have to buy her something?

Jerry: Hey the woman got you a job. The least you could do is buy her a gift. How about this?

George: What is that? Is that cashmere?

Jerry: Yeah. She would love cashmere.

George: Who doesn't like cashmere? Find me one person in the world that doesn't like cashmere. It's too expensive.

Jerry: Look at this. It's 85 dollars marked down from 600.

George: Wow. Excuse me, Miss?

Woman: Yes?

George: How come this sweater is only 85 dollars?

Woman: (showing the dot) Oh, here. This is why.

George: What? I don't see anything.

Woman: See this red dot?

George: Oh yeah.

Jerry: Oh it's damaged. (grabbing the sweater)

George: (grabbing the sweater back) Well it's not really damaged. 85 dollars huh?

Woman: There's no exchanges on this.

George: You think she would care about the red dot?

Jerry: It's hard to say.

George: I don't even think she'd notice it. Can you see it?

Jerry: Well I can see it.

George: Yeah, but you know where it is.

Jerry: Well what do you want me to do? Not look at it?

George: Pretend you didn't know it was there. Can you see it?

Jerry: It's hard to pretend because I know where it is.

George: Well just take an overview. Can't you just take an overview?

Jerry: You want me to take an overview?

George: Please.

Jerry: I see a very cheap man holding a sweater trying to get away with something. That's my overview.

At Jerry's apartment.

Jerry: Yeah so?

Elaine: He's acting very strangely. I think he started drinking again.

Jerry: Oh boy, can you smell it?

Elaine: No. I can't smell it.

Jerry: Well if you can't smell it then he hasn't been drinking.

Elaine: You don't always smell someone from a drink.

Jerry: Yes you do.

Elaine: What about one drink? Would you smell it from one drink?

Jerry: Yes you would.

Kramer enters

Jerry: I'll prove it. Would you do me a favor?

Kramer: Okay.

Jerry: Would you take a drink and let us smell you?

Kramer: You can smell me without the drink.

Elaine: I suspect that this guy I'm seeing might be drinking but I can't smell it.

Kramer: Okay, well what am I drinking? What do you got?

Jerry: I got a bottle of scotch my uncle gave me. It's Hennigans. It's been here for two years. I've been using it as a paint thinner.

Kramer drinks.

Kramer: All right.

Elaine and Jerry lean up really close to him.

Jerry: I don't smell anything.

Elaine: Maybe we're too close to the bottle.

Jerry's buzzer buzzes.

Jerry: Yeah.

George: (over the speaker) It's George.

Jerry: Come on up.

Kramer: That is *damn* good scotch. I could do a commercial for this stuff. Mmmmm, boy that Hennigans goes down smooth. And afterwords you don't even smell. That's right folks. I just had three shots of Hennigans and I don't smell. Imagine, you can walk around drunk all day. That's Hennigans, the no-smell, no-tell scotch.

George: Hello everybody.

Kramer: Hey. (snuggling really close to George) I'm going to tell you what I think. I know you don't care what I think, but I'm going to tell you. I think that you are terrific.

George: (uncomfortablly) Thank you.

Elaine: Hey what's that?

George: It's an early Christmas present.

Elaine: Christmas present? For who?

George: For you.

Elaine: *gasp* (pushing George) Get out of here.

Kramer: Say you got a big job interview, and you're a little nervous. Well throw back a couple shots of Hennigans and you'll be as loose as a goose and ready to roll in no time. And because it's odorless, why, it will be our little secret. (singing) h-e-double n...

Jerry: Kramer. Yeah that'll do.

Elaine: (opening the present) Oh George, this is beautiful. Is this cashmere?

George: Of course it's cashmere.

Elaine: Oh, I love cashmere.

George: Well who doesn't.

Elaine: My, George this must have cost a fortune.

George: Ahh, money.

Elaine: Jerry, how could you let him spend so much money?

Jerry: I tried to stop him. I couldn't. He just wants to make people happy.

Elaine: George, this is one of the nicest things anyone has ever given me.

George: Well good, good. Take it off you're going to wear it out already. It's for special occasions this thing.

Kramer: What's that red dot on your sweater?

Elaine: What?

George: Just take it off. I'm getting hot just looking at it.

Elaine: Uhh. This. It's like a red dot.

George: What red dot? What are you talking about? Jerry come here for a second. Do you see anything here?

Jerry: (uncomfortable) Uh, I don't know. Uh, I don't know.

Elaine: What don't you know?

Jerry: I don't know.

Elaine: Well do you see it or don't you?

Jerry: Ahem. Say that again?

Elaine: Do you see it or don't you?

Jerry: Do I see it... or don't I? That's the question.

Jerry goes to the counter and pours some scotch. He drinks it. He comes back groggy.

Jerry: Now what did you ask me again.

Kramer is snoring.

(Commercial)

(Whew, Jerry is saved by the bell.)

At the office. Elaine is walking by.

Elaine: You're still here. You're a dynamo.

George: I can't believe I get paid for this.

Elaine: I'll see you tomorrow.

Elaine walks out. George gets back to work. The cleaning lady comes by.

George: How you doing?

Cleaning lady: Hello.

The lady starts cleaning. George has a thought. He watches the lady as she is cleaning.

At Monk's.

Jerry: You had sex with the cleaning woman on your desk? Who are you, how did you do that?

George: Hennigans. I was there sitting in the office and the cleaning woman comes in. I've always been attracted to cleaning women. Cleaning women, chambermaids.

Jerry: Yeah chambermaids, I'm attracted to them too.

George: Why is that?

Jerry: It's a woman in your room. So go ahead.

George: So she starts vaccuming, back and forth, back and forth, her hips swivelling, her breasts, uh... (trying to think of a word)

Jerry: Convulsing?

George: Convulsing?

Jerry: I don't know, I'm trying to help you.

George: Then I asked her if she wanted a drink.

Jerry: You don't drink.

George: I know but I couldn't think of anything else to say to her.

Jerry: So you started drinking.

George: So we started drinking, and I'll tell you I don't know if it was the alcohol or the ammonia, but the next think I knew she was mopping the floor with me.

Jerry: So how was it?

George: Well the sex was okay, but I threw up from the Hennigans.

Jerry: Good thing the cleaning lady was there.

At Jerry's apartment.

Elaine: Dick was fired.

Jerry: You mean to tell me if I had put that drink six inches over to the right, and none of this would have happened.

Elaine: You knew he was an alcoholic. Why'd you put the drink down at all?

Jerry: What are you saying?

Elaine: I'm not saying anything.

Jerry: You're saying something.

Elaine: What could I be saying?

Jerry: Well you're not saying nothing you must be saying something.

Elaine: If I was saying something I would have said it.

Jerry: Well why don't you say it?

Elaine: I said it.

Jerry: What did you say?

Elaine: Nothing. It's exhausting being with you.

Jerry's buzzer buzzes.

Jerry: Yeah?

George: (over the speaker) It's George.

Jerry: Come on up.

Elaine: Hey, let me ask you something something. Did George buy that sweater knowing the red dot was on it because it was cheaper? (Jerry is unconfortable) Ooookay, you just gave me the answer.

Jerry: No I didn't.

Elaine: Yes you did, yes you did. I saw your expression.

Jerry: I didn't have an expression. I have a deviated septum. I have to open my mouth sometimes to breathe.

Elaine: How much did he save?

Jerry: Frankly I am shocked that you would ask such a question (Elaine sticking out her tongue like she isn't buying a word of it) of me, that you would think - the only surprise is how you could even think of that. That's what you were seeing.

Elaine gets up and goes into the bathroom.

George: I have to talk to Elaine. This cleaing lady is turning the screws on me. She's pushing for this whole relationship thing. She keeps calling me, threatening to go to the boss with this thing, I could lose my job, I gotta do something to keep her quiet.

Jerry: Elaine is in the bathroom. She's wise to whole red dot thing. She's asking me all kinds of questions.

George: Did you tell her anything?

Jerry: No.

George: Do you swear?

Jerry: I'm not swearing. I don't want to swear.

George: Oh you told her didn't you.

Jerry: No.

Elaine: Hey George, did you buy that sweater knowing that red dot was on it because you could get it at a discount?

George: What? Did I what?

Elaine: You did didn't you.

George: Elaine, I'm, I'm shocked. I'm shocked. Here I go out in the spirit of the season (Elaine looking like she's not buying a word of it) and spend all my savings to buy you the most beautiful Christmas sweater I have ever seen to show my appreciation to you at Christmas and this is the thanks that I get at Christmas.

Elaine: Well Jerry told me that you did.

George: You told her? How could you tell her? I told you not to say anything.

Jerry: I didn't tell her you stupid idiot. She tricked you.

George: Elaine you don't understand. I had 103 temperature when I bought that sweater. I was so dizzy I was seeing red dots everywhere. I thought everything in the store had a red dot on it. I couldn't distinguish one red dot from another. I couldn't afford anything. I have nothing. I haven't worked for a really long time. (Jerry is standing right behind George. Jerry takes out a hankerchief and starts fake-crying in it.) I mean look, I have no clothes, look at what I'm wearing. It's just a little red dot.

At the office.

George: This is for you.

Lady: Oh, Georgie, you bought this for me? Oh I knew you cared for me.

George: As you care for me. Which is why it is very important that you never breathe a word of this to anyone about the... you know. What, with Clarence Thomas and everything.

Lady: Okay, okay, can I open it now?

George: Yes of course go ahead. My guess is you're going to like this very much.

Lady: Oh! Is that cashmere?

George: Of course it's cashemere.

Lady: A cashmere sweater. Oh Georgie Porgie!

George: Just a little something for Christmas.

Lady: When I was a little girl in Panama, a rich American came to our town and he was wearing the softest most beautiful sweater. I said to him, "what do you call this most beautiful fabric?", and he said "they call it cashmere". I repeated the words "cashmere, cashmere". I asked if I could have it, and he said "No. Get away from me." Then he started walk away. But I grabbed onto his leg screaming for him to give me the sweater and he dragged me through the street. And then he kicked at me with the other foot and threw some change at me. Oh, but I didn't want the change Georgie. I wanted the cashmere.

George: I had a feeling you would like it. No, don't try it on now, try it on later.

Lady: Wow, look at this. It feels so beautiful.

George: Take it off. You're going to ruin it.

Lady: (noticing the dot) What's this?

At the comedy club.

Jerry: I was in the men's room the other day and they had the hand blower, instead of the paper towels, you know this thing. I like the hand blower I have to say. It takes a little bit longer, but I feel when you're in a room with a revolting stench you want to spend as much time as you can.

Dick: The only stench is comming from you.

Audience: Oooooh.

Jerry: Oh, wait a second, I believe we have a heckler ladies and gentlemen. Hey Dick I don't know what your problem is. It's not my fault you're back on the wagon.

Dick: It's off the wagon.

Jerry: In the old days how do you think they got the alcohol from town to town?

Dick: I don't know.

Jerry: On the wagon. Don't you think they broke into a couple of those bottles along the way?

Dick: You can't drink on a wagon it would be too bumpy.

Jerry: They had smooth trails. What about the Cumberland Gap?

Dick: What the hell do you know about wagons?

Jerry: I know enough not to get on them.

In the boss' office.

Boss: I'm going to get right to the point. It has come to my attention that you and the cleaning woman have engaged in sexual intercourse on the desk in your office. Is that correct?

George: Who said that?

Boss: She did.

George: Was that wrong? Should I have not done that? I tell you I gotta plead ingnorance on this thing because if anyone had said anything to me at all when I first started here that that sort of thing was frouned upon, you know, cause I've worked in a lot of offices and I tell you peope do that all the time.

Boss: You're fired.

George: Well you didn't have to say it like that.

Boss: I want you out of here by the end of the day.

George: What about the whole Christmas spirit thing? Any flexability there?

Boss: Nah. Wait, wait, she wanted me to give you this.

He tosses the sweater and it lands right on top of George's face. George walks out of the office "wearing" it.

In the hall of the office.

Elaine: You had sex on your desk with the cleaning woman.

George: You never had sex in the office before?

Elaine: No. I once made out with someone but that was it.

George: Alright so you made out with someone.

Elaine: Well that's not sex.

George: Kissing is sex.

Elaine: Kissing is not sex.

Jerry: George?

George: Jerry.

Elaine: Hey, did Jerry leave that drink next to Dick's on purpose?

George: No.

Jerry: George?

George: Over here.

Elaine: What are you doing here?

Jerry: I'm taking the kid out to dinner to chear him up.

Elaine: Hey Jerry when do you consider that sex has taken place?

Jerry: I would say when the nipple makes its first appearance.

(Commercial)

Elaine: So, George told me that you left the drink next to Dick's on purpose.

Jerry: Nice try. So guess who heckled me at the club last night.

*crash*

Dick: Merry Christmas.

Elaine: Oh my god that's Dick. It's Cape Fear.

George: Hide, hide under the desk.

Elaine: Ow, ow move over.

Jerry: Get off of me.

Elaine: I've got no room.

Dick walks over dragging behind him a Christmas tree. He looks down and notices them under the table. George holds out the sweater, his hand shaking.

Dick: Is that cashmere?

George: Of course it's cashmere.

Dick: (noticing the dot) What's this?

At the comedy club.

Jerry: But in a way, I think I inadvertantly turned this guy into an alcoholic. I hate being around alcoholics because they're either telling you how much they love you or how much they hate you. And those are the two statements that scare me the most. But I think he's okay now because I have no idea how he feels about me. He's finally off the wagon.

Dick: You mean on the wagon.

Jerry: Don't get smart.

Jerry's Apartment

George: ...pianist. A *classical* pianist. She *plays* the piano. She's a

*brilliant* woman. I-I-I sat in her living room... She played the

*Waldstein Sonata*! The *Waldstein*!

George: We did a crossword puzzle together, *in bed*. It was the most fun

I ever had in my entire life. Did you hear me? in my *life*!

Y'know?

Jerry enters

Jerry: Were you talking? I couldn't hear anything.

George: I was telling you about Noel.

Jerry: Oh, Noel! Yeah, the one who plays bongos...

George: [sarcastically] Heh heh heh... So side-splittingly funny...

Jerry: All right, I'm sorry. What about her?

George: What, you think I'm going to repeat the whole thing now?

Jerry: I know, you told me you like her, everything is going good.

George: No everything is *not* going good. I'm very uncomfortable. I have

no power. I mean, why should she have the upper hand. *Once* in

my life I would like the upper hand. I have no hand-- no hand at

all. She has the hand; I have *no* hand...

George: How do I get the hand?

Jerry: We all want the hand. Hand is tough to get. You gotta get the

hand right from the opening.

George: She's playing a recital this week at the McBierney School. You wanna hear her play? I got two extra tickets, you and Elaine could go...

Jerry: Yeah, that sounds like somethin'...

George: Then afterwards maybe we could all go out together. Y'know she'll

see me with my friends, she'll observe me as I really am, as myself.

Maybe I can get some hand that way.

Kramer enters

Kramer: Hey, smell my arm... Smell it!

George: With all due respect, I don't think so...

Jerry: That smells good, what is that?

Kramer: The *beach*!

Jerry: The *beach*?

George: What, did you go swimmin'? It's 29 degrees out!

Kramer: I just joined the Polar Bear Club.

Jerry: You joined the *Polar Bears*?!

George: What the Hell is a "Polar Bear"?

Kramer: Well, it's these people-- they go swimmin' in the winter. They're terrific, I just took my first swim today. Brrrrrrr! It's invigorating....

Jerry: Yeah... So's shock therapy.

Jerry: [with glee] What is that, a Pez dispenser?!

Kramer: Want one? Yeah, I just bought it at the Flea Market.

George: Hey, what goes on there, exactly?

Jerry: You don't know?

George: No, I-I-I know... [retreats back to his Chinese take out] I know...

Jerry: You think they have fleas there, don't you?

George: *No*...

Jerry: Yes you do, Biff. You've never been to a Flea Market, and you

think they have fleas there.

George: All right, I think they have fleas there. So what...

ElainElaine: I don't know how anyone does this. It must be *so* nerve racking...

How do they warm up their fingers?

Jerry: They have a piano backstage they warm up on.

ElainElaine: *No*, we would have heard it.

Jerry: What, do you think they just crack their knuckles and come out?

George: I told her we'd all go out afterwards, okay? And don't applaud

when she stops playing the first time. It's not over yet.

Jerry: [quickly whispering] I resent that you said that! That's

directed at *me*, isn't it?!

A very elegant Noel comes out and sits at her piano.

Jerry: Is this okay? Can I do this? (he claps)

% Noel begins. Dramatically. It's enough to make a man reach for his

% candy pooper. Jerry helps himself to a Pez, he stands Tweety up on Elaine's

% purse on her lap. Elaine valiantly tries to hold back her laughter,

% but it escalates from a giggle to a chortle to a chuckle to laughter

% to snorting. Noel is visibly shaken and she has difficulty playing

% with this anonymous distraction from one of the unwashed masses. Elaine

% removes herself from the auditorium, all the while snorting and gasping

% for breath, (we're talkin' full-on gales of laughter, here). Outside,

% she runs into an old acquaintance.

Steve: Something I said? [no response] It's John... Mollika.

ElainElaine: Oh, oh, *John*... Oh, hi John... Hi...

Steve: What're you doing down here?

ELAINE: Oh, I was just at this recital and Jerry put a Pez dispenser on my leg and I

started laughing.

MOLLIKA: Jerry's in there? I heard you guys broke up.

ELAINE: We did. We're just hanging out.

MOLLIKA: REally. ... You really look great.

ELAINE: Oh, uh, thank you. Are you still friends with Richie Appel?

MOLLIKA: Oh, Richie, he's been doing comedy in L. A. for a few years. He

just got back a month ago. He's kind of messed up. On drugs.

I don't know what to do for the guy.

ELAINE: Have you thought about an intervention?

MOLLIKA: What's that?

ELAINE: You get all his friends in a room, They confront himm to try to get

him into rehab. It's a very popular thing now.

MOLLIKA: He'd never listen to anyone. ... Except of course Jerry. He'd listen to

Jerry. Jerry would have to be involved. He really respects Jerry.

Cut to Jerry playing with Tweety Bird Pez dispenser.

Outside Noel's dressing room

ElainElaine: I'm sorry. George, I'm sorry!

George: What did you put the Pez dispenser on her leg for in the first

place?

Jerry: I dunno, it was an impulse.

George: What kind of a sick impulse does that??

Jerry: How could I know she would start to laugh?

ElainElaine: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I *am*!

Jerry: Can we just go in already?

George: What are we gonna tell her?

ElainElaine: I'll tell her I was the one who laughed.

George: No, don't say a word. If she thinks my friends are jerks, then

I'm a *jerk*...

ElainElaine: [To Jerry] Oh, remind me to talk to you about something later.

Jerry: What about?

George: Hey, hey! We're discussing something!

Jerry: I know, but I'm distracted now.

George: What are you? A *baby*!? All right. Tell her.

E When I was outside I ran into John Mollika.

JERRY: Really John Mollika, they guy that used to bartend at the Comedy Club. How's he doing?

ELAINE: He's good.

George: Uh, can we cut to the chase?

Jerry: "Cut to the chase"?

George: Yeah...

Jerry: What're you, "Joe Hollywood"?

George: A lot of people say it.

Jerry: I would lose that.

George: [Accusingly] What's *that*?

Jerry: "Lose that"? That's not a Hollywood expression!

George: [Realizing full well it isn't] ...Yes it is.

ELAINE: Anyway ... So John told me that Richie is in town from

Los Angeles and he's really messed up on drugs. So I told

him that he should do an intervention.

JERRY: Really, an intervention ...

George: Y'know people, we got a situation over here!

ELAINE: Yeah, but he want's you to be a part of it.

JERRY: Me? Why me?

ELAINE: 'Cause Richie really respects you and he would listen to you.

Jerry: Y'know these things are *really* hard to load...

GEORGE: All right, OK, I'm goin' in.

JERRY: We've got to talk about this (to Elaine)

ELAINE: All right.

[They Enter]

GEORGE: Hi, hi, hi, You were wonderful.

NOEL: No..

GEORGE: Oh, these are my friends, Elaine and Jerry, ... Noel

Jerry: You play a *Hell* of a piano.

Elaine: Yeah, I was really moved, *really* moved.

NOEL: Well didn't you hear that person laughing? I couldn't play. I was

*humiliated...

Elaine: Well, I'm sure it wasn't *at* you.

Noel: Well then, what was she laughing at?

Jerry: Pez?

NOEL: Uh, no, No thank you. Did you see her?

GEORGE: Me, uh, uh, no, ...

JERRY: Anyone who would laugh at a recital is probably some sort of lunatic anyway. I mean only a sick twisted mind could be that rude and ignorant.

ELAINE: Maybe some mental defective put something stupid on her leg.

JERRY: Even if this so called mental defective did put something on her leg she's still the one who laughed.

NOEL: I'll never forget that laugh for the rest of my life. [exits]

ELAINE: I'm sure she would apologize if she could. Probably somebody is holding her back against every fibre in her being.

GEORGE: If she want's to continue to have a fibre of her being she'll be very careful (hitting each other)

[Noel enters]

GEORGE: All right, so are you ready, so we'll go out and get something to eat.

NOEL: I don't feel like it tonight.

JERRY: We'll be outside

ELAINE: Yeah

JERRY: It was nice meeting you By the way, How do you warm up your fingers before you play?

N: I just crack my knuckles.

GEORGE: We'll have a good time

N: I don't feel like it

GEORGE: Ah, come on

N: I said I DON'T FEEL LIKE IT!

GEORGE: Um, all right, um, uh, I'll call 'ya. I'll call you and we'll talk on the phone. A telephone communiqu. Every thing is fine ok, uh, fine, .. [exits]

[MONKS]

JERRY: You know I thing Kramer might have been responsible for getting Richie involved with drugs in the first place.

ELAINE: What? How?

JERRY: A few years ago the comedy club had a softball team. Kramer was our first baseman You couldn't get anything by him It was unbelievable.

Anyway this one game we came back to win from like 8 runs behind. So Kramer says to Richie why don't you dump the bucket of Gatorade on Marty Benson's head? The club owner. So Richie goes ahead and does it.

ELAINE: So? What happened?

JERRY: What happened? The guy was like 67 years old, it was freezing out, he caught a cold, got pneumonia,

and a month later he was dead.

ELAINE: Shut up!

JERRY: All the comedians were happy. He was one of these club owners nobodu liked anyway. But Richie was never the same.

ELAINE: Whar about Kramer?

JERRY: He's the same!

[Jerry on phone at home]

JERRY: Are you sure you want me John. I have spoken to Richie in two years. I don't have a good apartment for

an intervention. The furniture, it's very non-confrontational. All right All right. Goodbye.

[to Kramer] Remember Ricie Appel?

KRAMER: (looks shocked) Oh sure, the guy I told to pour the Gatorade that killed Marty Benson?

JERRY: Right, we'll John Mollika is organizing some kind of intervention for him. We're having it here.

KRAMER: Can I get in on that?

JERRY: What do you think? It's like a poker game?

KRAMER: Is Elaine going?

JERRY: Yeah

KRAMER: Well, I knew him as well as she did.

JERRY: Yeah, but John invited her.

KRAMER: So what are you saying, you don't want me to intervene?

JERRY: No, intervene, go intervene all you want. I am just afraid you might be interfering while we're intervening.

Buzzer

GEORGE: It's George

JERRY: Stop smelling your arm.

KRAMER: You know I got a great idea for a cologne. The Beach. You spray it on and you smell like you just

came home from the beach

JERRY: Hum, a cologne that smells like the beach. I can't believe I'm saying this, "That's not a bad idea."

KRAMER: Tell me about it!

JERRY: Why don't you call Steve D'Jiff, he works in the marketing department at Calvin Klein.

In fact he's a good friend of John Mollika and Richie also.

[George enters]

GEORGE: Well it's over. It's definitely over.

JERRY: She broke up with you?

GEORGE: No, but I can tell she's going to. I can sense it. We had this terrible phone conversation.

I was so nervous before I called I made up this whole list of things to talk about.

JERRY: What was on the list?

GEORGE: Let's see, How I'm very good at going in reverse in my car, why isn't Postum a more popular drink,

JERRY: Yeah, Postum is under-ratted,

GEORGE: Anyway there was all this tension. I asked her if she wanted to go out to dinner and she said

"no, maybe we could get together for lunch." You know what that means.

JERRY: What's wrong with lunch?

GEORGE: Lunch is fine at the beginning then you move on to dinner. you don't move back to lunch. It's like being demoted.

I'll never do another crossword puzzle with her again. I know it.

KRAMER: I like the Jumble You ever do the Jumble?

GEORGE: I have no power Do you understand? I need hand. I have no hand.

KRAMER: Break up with her

GEORGE: What?

KRAMER: You break up with her. You reverse everything that way.

JERRY: A preemptive breakup.

GEORGE: A preemptive breakup. This is an incredible idea. I got nothing to lose.

We either break up which she would do anyway but at least I go out with some

Dignity. Completely turn the tables. It's absolutely brilliant.

[MONKS]

GEORGE: So, I am have to going to break up with you.

NOEL: You're breaking up with me?

GEORGE: I, ... am breaking up with, ... you.

NOEL: Wow.

GEORGE: Shocked?

NOEL: I really am.

GEORGE: Never expected this did you?

NOEL: I thought everything was fine.

GEORGE: Well, live and learn.

NOEL: I don't understand. You're breaking up with me. Didn't we have fun doing the crossword puzzles?

GEORGE: Kind of.

NOEL: I'm very confused.

GEORGE: Well, I didn't mean to hurt you kid.

NOEL: I thought,...

GEORGE: Now, stop it ...

NOEL: What do you want, I can make you happy.

GEORGE: When you're playing the piano do you think about me?

NOEL: I don't know.

GEORGE: This is what I'm talking about.

NOEL: OK, I'll think about you.

GEORGE: All the time.

NOEL: All the time? ... OK, All the time.

GEORGE: I can't hear you.

NOEL: All the time. ALL THE TIME.

GEORGE: See, It's not so hard.

[CALVIN KLEIN]

KRAMER: Go ahead smell, smell

STEVE: Yeah, so?

KRAMER: Do you recognize it? ... The beach.

STEVE: What are you talking about?

KRAMER: Oh, I'm talking about the beach.

STEVE: What about it?

KRAMER: You know the way you smell when you first come home from the beach?

Well, I want to make a cologne that captures the essence of that smell.

Oh yeah.

STEVE: That is the dumbest idea I have ever heard.

KRAMER: Oh, wait, Did you here what I just said?

STEVE: Do you think people are going to pay $80 a bottle to smell like dead

fish and sea weed? That's why people take showers when the come

home from the beach. It's an objectionable offensive odour.

KRAMER: So you don't think it's a good idea?

The Intervention [NOTE: I may have confused the names of some of the male interveners below]

To Elaine

GUY: The membranes get dried and it just starts bleeding. Since I was a

kid so I have to stick tissue up there

ELAINE: (very uninterested) Uh, you have to work like that?

GUY: Nobody minds Nobody has ever said anything to me.

To Jerry

OTHER GUY: Are there any ice cubes?

JERRY: In the freezer.

OTHER GUY: I looked. There aren't any ice cubes.

JERRY: Well I guess there aren't any ice cubes.

OTHER GUY: I can't drink this. It's warm! (walks away)

Guy: Shouldn't we rehearse this a little bit before Richie comes?

Steve: What's the plan?

JERRY: Do I have to talk? I don't feel like talking.

OTHER GUY: Well, if he's not going to talk I'm not going to talk either.

GUY: No, we all have to talk.

ELAINE: What's the order?

GUY: We'll go in alphabetical order. First Roberta.

ROBERTA: Why am I first?

ELAINE: Albano is your last name.

ROBERTA: That's not my name any more. I'm divorced.

Steve: I'll go first.

Kramer enters

KRAMER: Hey.

JERRY: Hey.

KRAMER: Is this the interference?

JERRY: Intervention.

OTHER GUY: What are you doing here?

KRAMER: Uh, is it all right if I stay for the intervention?

Steve: Hey, this is for close friends only.

KRAMER: I'm a friend. Who do you think told him to pour the Gatorade

over Marty Benson's head?

OTHER GUY: Let him stay.

KRAMER: Hey, you know I got someone to make up that cologne for me, big mouth.

Steve: Somebody's going to make that crap?

Some old guys enter

Old Guy: Kramer!

KRAMER: Hey, come on, these are some of my polar bear buddies.

OTHER GUY: They can't stay.

Old Guy: We're having a party here?

JERRY: No, we're having an intervention

Old Guy: An intervention? Who's intervening?

JERRY: There's a friend of ours on drugs and we're going to confront him.

OLD GUY: Sure, we used to do that when one of our polar bears stopped

coming. We would go to his house and say, "What you don't want to be a

polar bear anymore? It's too cold for you?"

Buzzer

GUY: It's him.

Roberta: What should we do?

ELAINE: Hide!

JERRY: It's NOT a surprise party! Yeah (to intercom)

GEORGE: It's George

JERRY: Yeah, come on up. ... It's not him.

GUY: If you don't go out with me it's because I'm a bar tender.

ELAINE: Look, I don't think this is appropriate right now.

GUY: Is it because I have a tissue in my nose?

ELAINE: You're getting warm.

George and Noel enter (Noel looks awful)

GEORGE: We just came from Chadway's(?) What's going on.

JERRY: We're having the intervention for Richie.

GEORGE: Oh, right, right, the intervention. Should we leave?

JERRY: Well, uh..

NOEL: (happily) Elaine, hi.

ELAINE: Oh, hi Noel

(Noel sits on couch with Elaine with Old Guy between them)

JERRY: Well, you're looking well.

GEORGE: Jerry, let me tell you something, "A man without hand is not a man."

I got so much hand I'm coming out of my gloves. I got to thank Kramer.

Steve: Even if I were dragged through manure I still wouldn't put that stuff on.

GEORGE: (to Kramer) This man is a genius. Genius!

Steve: You think so?

GEORGE: I don't think so I know so, Kramer, come here I got to talk to you

Old Man: The male kangaroo doesn't have a pouch only the female has it. The male has pouch envy.

ELAINE: (Chuckles)

Old GUY; at least give me a pocket.

ELAINE: (laughs)

Noel turns to Elaine. Jerry raises his eyes to heaven

NOEL: That laugh. That's the laugh. That's it. You're the one.

ELAINE: No, no. It was an accident. It really wasn't my fault. It was Jerry.

Jerry put a Pez dispenser on my leg.

NOEL: You put a Pez dispenser on her leg during my recital?.

JERRY: I didn't know she would laugh.

NOEL: You lied to me George, you lied to me.

GEORGE: No, I, uh, um, wa, wa, What did I do? ... Where are you going?

NOEL: I ... am breaking up ... with you!

GEORGE: You can't break up with me. I've got hand.

NOEL: And you're going to need it.

Noel exits, George chases her

Richie and John enter

JERRY: Hey Richie

RICHIE: So what's going on?

Later

JERRY: It was pretty ugly from the get go. he's not listening, He's hostile, he's

talking back.

GEORGE: I can't do these puzzles.

JERRY: So he starts to get up He spots the Pez dispenser on the coffee table

GEORGE: Ah ah Pez dispenser.

JERRY: He picks it up - he stares at it - It's like he's hypnotized by it. Then he's

telling us this story about how when he was a kid he was in the car with his father, and

his father was trying to load one of them

GEORGE: Well they're hard to load.

JERRY: Tell me something I don't know. So as the father's trying to load it he loses control

of the car and it crashes into a high school cafeteria. Nobody's hurt but Pez is all

over the car. And the dispenser was destroyed virtually beyond recognition.

GEORGE: Poor kid.

JERRY: So as he's telling the story he starts crying.

GEORGE: What did you do?

JERRY: What do you think? I gave him my Pez dispenser.

GEORGE: Wow

JERRY: Two hours later he checks into Smither's clinic. I talked to the doctor yesterday.

He's doing great on the rehab. He's hooked on Pez. He's eating them like there's no tomorrow.

GEORGE: What's a three letter word for candy?

JERRY: I can't do those things.

END

Monologue
The thing I don’t understand about the suicide person is the people who try and commit suicide for some reason they don’t die and that’s it. They stop trying. Why? Why don’t they just keep trying? What has changed? Is their life any better now? No. In fact it’s worse because now they’ve found out one more thing you stink at. Okay, that’s why these people don’t succeed in life to begin with. Because they give up too easy. I saw, pills don’t work, try a rope. Car won’t start in the garage, get a tune up. You know what I mean? There’s nothing more rewarding than reaching a goal you have set for yourself.

[Jerry’s Apartment]

JERRY: Let me ask you a question. If you named a kid Rasputin do you think that would have a negative effect on his life?

ELAINE: Na.

JERRY: What are you doing? We’re going out for dinner in ten minutes.

ELAINE: Do you realize this is the last meal I am going to have for three days?

[buzzer]

JERRY: Yeah.

GEORGE: It’s George.

JERRY: Come on up. . . . I never heard of this. You’ve got to fast for three days to take an ulcer test. How you gonna do that?

ELAINE: I don’t know. How could I possibly have ulcers? Who could have given me ulcers?

JERRY: I think I’ll take out the garbage.

ELAINE: Hey, have you ever fasted?

JERRY: Well, once I didn’t have dinner until, like 9:00 o’clock, that was pretty rough. [exits to hall with garbage – meets George] Hey, do me a favour will ya’? Throw out my garbage for me.

GEORGE: Yeah, right.

JERRY: Come on, it’s just down the hall.

GEORGE: Give me two bucks. I’ll do it for two bucks.

JERRY: I’ll give you 50 cents.

GEORGE: There’s no way I touch that bag for less than two dollars.

JERRY: Come on. Fifty cents. <??> a piece of Drake’s coffee cake

GEORGE: You’re not getting no Drake’s Coffee Cake for fifty cents. Yae, Hey, I’m all set. I got the ticket. I’m going to the Cayman Islands this Friday.

JERRY: I don’t get you. Who goes on vacation without a job? What do you need a break from getting up at eleven?

GEORGE: It’s an incredible deal. I don’t know why you don’t come with me.

JERRY: Nah, I don’t go for these non-refundable deals. I can’t commit to a woman. I’m not going to commit to an airline.

[Gina enters the hall]

GINA: Hi.

JERRY: Hi.

GINA: How are you?

JERRY: Gina, do you know what a Drake’s Coffee Cake is?

GINA: Of course, the plane cake with the sweet brown crumbs on the top.

JERRY: How much do they cost?

GINA: The junior?

GEORGE: No, no the full size.

JERRY: No, no the junior.

GEORGE: You didn’t say "junior".

GINA: I haven’t had one of those since I was a little girl.

JERRY: Really? You should be ashamed of yourself. I want you out of here! [MARTIN enters the hall] How ya’ doing?

MARTIN: Good enough.

[MARTIN leaves with Gina]

JERRY: Boy she’s sexy isn’t she?

[Jerry leaves garbage bag by Kramer’s apartment and knocks on the door. As he and George enter Jerry’s apartment Kramer comes out and takes the garbage bag.]

JERRY: Do you believe that guy?

ELAINE: What guy?

JERRY: My neighbour:

ELAINE: Oh, that creepy guy?

JERRY: Yeah, did he think I was flirting with her?

GEORGE: He didn’t seem too pleased.

ELAINE: Maybe I’ll get a steak with french fried onion wings.

GEORGE: hey, you know what? I just remembered something. I had a dream about that guy last night. This is amazing.

JERRY: What’s so amazing? You’ve seen him before.

GEORGE: I haven’t seen him for months.

JERRY: What was the dream?

GEORGE: I was doing standup comedy in Kennebunkport Maine. ??? night club. The stage was on a cliff and the audience was throwing all the comics off.

JERRY: I think I’ve played there.

GEORGE: I’ve had a lot of other paranormal stuff happen to me.

JERRY: You’re a little paranormal

ELAINE: Hey, George, you know my friend goes to a psychic.

GEORGE: Really?

ELAINE: Uh uh, you should go some time.

GEORGE: I’d love to go. Make an appointment.

JERRY: Psychics, vacations. How about getting a job?

GEORGE: I just got fired.

JERRY: Alright, come on, lets get out of here.

ELAINE: I wonder what Ghandi ate before his fast.

JERRY: I heard he used to polish off a box of Triscuits.

ELAINE: Really?

JERRY: Oh, yeah. Ghandi loved Triscuits.

[They exit]

[Jerry’s apartment late at night there is knocking at the door]

JERRY: Who is it? Who is it?

GINA: It’s Gina.

JERRY: Who?

GINA: Martine’s girl friend.

JERRY: Martine?

GINA: You next door neighbour.

JERRY: Oh, Martin!

[Jerry opens door]

GEORGE: It’s Martine. I think he’s dying. He tried to kill himself with pills.

JERRY: What?

GINA: Come on.

JERRY: In my pajamas? I better get my robe.

GINA: We don’t have enough time.

JERRY: It’ll take two seconds.

GINA: There is no time.

JERRY: We don’t have two seconds?

GINA: All right. Go ahead.

JERRY: Nah, forget it.

GINA: No, go ahead.

JERRY: Nah. I’ll just wear the pajamas.

GINA: Will you just get it.

JERRY: Are you sure?

GINA: Forget it. Come on.

JERRY: Nah, I’ll go get the robe.

[Metropolitan Hospital Center]

JERRY: That’s not too bad. It’s not like a Sunny von Bulow comma. The doctor said he should snap out of it anytime.

GINA: You know why he did this? Because I told him it was over. I did not want to see him anymore.

JERRY: Really? It’s over?

GINA: I could not stand it another minute. Yesterday he turned over a man’s hot dog stand because he thought the man was looking at me. And then after he saw you in the hall. Ach, he was crazy with jealousy.

JERRY: Oh boy, did he say anything about me?

GINA: He does not like you. And all indications are he does not like Drake’s Coffee Cake.

JERRY: He said that?

GINA: He was screaming about it all night. How it’s too sweet and it falls apart when you eat it.

JERRY: I’m sorry if I caused any trouble. I was just being friendly.

GINA: I wasn’t.

JERRY: You weren’t?

GINA: No, I have thought about you many times. Have you thought about me?

JERRY: Of course.

GINA: Tell me everything.

JERRY: Are you sure he can’t hear anything? . . .MARTIN, MARTIN.

GINA: I wish he was not in a coma. I wish he was dead. I wish I could pull the plug out from him.

JERRY: I, would, I would wait on that. I know how you feel but. Juries today, you never know how they’re going to look at a thing like this.

GINA: I saw you looking at your watch. You want to leave? Go ahead.

JERRY: No, I just wanted to see what time it was.

GINA: Are you afraid of him?

JERRY: No.

GINA: Then kiss me.

JERRY: Here?

GINA: Yes, right here.

JERRY: Is this the proper venue?

GINA: You don’t want to?

JERRY: No, no, I want to. I, I very much want to. I, I desire to. I, I pine to.

GINA: Then kiss me right in front of him.

JERRY: I can’t. What if he wakes up?

GINA: A man is lying here unconscious and you’re afraid of him? What kind of a man are you?

JERRY: A man who respects a good comma. If it was one of those in and out comas, maybe. But when a guy’s got a coma going like this … you don’t want to mess with it.

[Jerry’s apartment]

KRAMER: Hey.

JERRY: Hey.

KRAMER: Did you hear about Martin?

JERRY: Yeah, I heard.

KRAMER: I can’t believe he’s in a coma.

KRAMER: He’s got my vacuum cleaner. You know I loaned it to him. He never returned it. The carpets are filthy. What am I going to do?

JERRY: Who told you about Martin?

KRAMER: Newman! He’s good friends with him.

Jx; Oh, big mouth Newman. I should have guessed.

KRAMER: He’s got all of my attachments, you know.

JERRY: Hey, let me ask you something. How long do you have to wait for a guy to come out of a coma before you can ask his ex-girlfriend out?

KRAMER: What, Gina? Why wait? Why not just call Doctor Kavorkian?

JERRY: You know I don’t get that whole suicide machine. There’s no tall buildings where these people live? They can’t wrap their lips around a revolver like a normal person?

KRAMER: So what’s going on between you and Gina?

JERRY: Well, I went with her to the hospital last night.

KRAMER: Uh, uh.

JERRY: So we’re in the room and she’s trying to get me to kiss her right in front of him.

KRAMER: Uh, uh, you see that’s the great thing about Mediterranean women. All right, so what did you do?

JERRY: Nothing.

KRAMER: Ah, what kind of a man are you? The guy is unconscious in a coma and you don’t have the guts to kiss his girlfriend?

JERRY: I didn’t know what the coma etiquette was.

KRAMER: There is no coma etiquette. You see that’s the beauty of the coma, man. It doesn’t matter what you do around it.

JERRY: So you’re saying, his girl, his car, his clothes, it’s all up for grabs. You can just loot the coma victim.

KRAMER: I’d give him 24 hours to get out of it. They can’t get out of it in 24 hours, it’s a land rush.

JERRY: So if the coma victim wakes up in a month, he’s thrilled, he got out of the coma. He goes home, there’s nothing left?

KRAMER: NOTHING LEFT! That’s why I’m trying to get that vacuum cleaner. Because somebody’s going to grab it.

[The psychic’s apartment]

RULA: Martin’s spirit came to you as a warning.

ELAINE: Why would he come to George?

RULA: Because George has heightened extra sensory perception. FAYGY GET YOUR FINGER OUT OF YOUR NOSE.

GEORGE: I knew it. I always felt different.

RULA: You are. Some coffee cake?

GEORGE: Drakes?

RULA: Yes.

GEORGE: Did you buy this for me?

RULA: No, why?

GEORGE: Ha, because I love Drake’s Coffee Cake.

RULA: Maybe I did.

ELAINE: Take it away.

GEORGE: She hasn’t eaten in two days.

RULA: Who’s Pauline?

GEORGE: Pauline? . . . Wait a minute. I got it. My brother once impregnated a woman named Pauline.

RULA: Do you think about her?

GEORGE: When I hear her name mentioned.

RULA: Cut these with your left hand.

GEORGE: There was a woman, Audrey. She had a very big nose.

RULA: I see an Audrey, but with a small nose.

GEORGE: Yes, yes, she had a nose job. I loved her very deeply. Will she ever speak to me again?

RULA: Not in this life.

ELAINE: Should you be smoking?

RULA: Does it bother you?

ELAINE: You’re pregnant.

GEORGE: Elaine.

RULA: I smoked when I had Faisy.

RULA: Ah oh.

GEORGE: Ah oh? What? What Ah oh?

RULA: I don’t know about this trip George.

GEORGE: You can see the Cayman Islands in there? Is something going to happen to me? What?

ELAINE: It’s really bad for the fetus. Do you know that.

GEORGE: Elaine, she’s a psychic. She knows how the kid’s going to be.

GEORGE: Should I not go on this trip?

RULA: George, I am going to tell you something and I want you to really hear me.

ELAINE: Now listen. I just don’t know how a person, with everything we now know about pre-natal care can put a cigarette in her mouth.

GEORGE: Elaine, what are you doing?

ELAINE: It’s disgusting.

RULA: I DON’T BELIVE IT. I would like you both to leave.

ELAINE: Oh fine, I don’t like to be around people who are just so irresponsible.

RULA: Get the hell out.

[Elaine leaving]
GEORGE: A plane crash? A Heart attack? Lupus? Is it Lupus?

RULA: Do you want me to call the super? He was an Israeli commando.

GEORGE: If you don’t say anything I will assume it’s a plane crash.

RULA: Get out.

GEORGE: Not a plane crash. [leaving] Is it a plane crash?

[Jerry’s apartment]

GINA: I do not like your toothbrush. There are no bristles.

JERRY: You can say what you want about me but I’ll be damned if I’m going to stand here while you insult my toothbrush.

GINA: It is too small for someone with such a big mouth [kisses Kerry]. Let me ask you. What will you do if Martine wakes up? Run away like a mouse?

JERRY: No, more like the Three Stooges at the end of every movie.

GINA: Who are these Stooges you speak of?

JERRY: They’re a comedy team.

GINA: Tell me about them. Everything.

JERRY: Well, they’re three kind of funny looking guys and they hit each other a lot.

GINA: You will show me The Stooges?

JERRY: I will show you The Stooges.

GINA: When?

JERRY: Well, I don’t really know where The Stooges are right now but if I locate them you will be the first to know.

GINA: Come, you walk me to a cab.

JERRY: Well, uh, I uh, I don’t want you to get upset or anything but uh, with Martin and all, well maybe it’s not such a good idea for us to be seen together in the building, because, you know, he had a lot of friends here.

GINA: You’re still afraid. You are not a man.

JERRY: Well then what are all those ties and sport jackets doing in my closet?

GINA: Are you going to walk me to a cab or not?

JERRY: Yeah, all right. All right.

[Jerry and Gina meet Kramer and leaving his apartment with Newman]

KRAMER: You should just eat fruit.

NEWMAN: I can’t eat fruit. It makes me incontinent.

KRAMER: ???

NEWMAN: Hello Gina. Hello Jerry.

JERRY: Hello Newman.

[Metropolitan Hospital Center - Hallway]

JERRY: Do you think Newman would tell Martin if he wakes up? What kind of sicko would do that? He could kill me.

GEORGE: People smoke, Elaine. My mother smoked. It didn’t hurt me.

ELAINE: [jumps with fear to Jerry] Did you see that wall move?

JERRY: Boy, it’s a good thing we came.

GEORGE: Could there be a native p0roblem in the Caymans? Maybe there’s native unrest.

ELAINE: Hi, I haven’t eaten in three days. I was wondering how much longer it would be until I get my X-ray.

Nurse: We’ll call you.

JERRY: George, I want you to promise me something. If I’m ever in a comma. In the first 24 hours get everything out of my apartment and put it in storage.

GEORGE: How come?

JERRY: Looters.

ELAINE: How do we know that dog food is any good? Who tastes it?

JERRY: She’s really hungry.

[Kramer enters]

KRAMER: Hey.

ELAINE: Kramer

KRAMER: Well, Newman’s upstairs visiting Martin.

GEORGE: Would you buy my Cayman Island ticket?

KRAMER: You’re not going?

GEORGE: No.

KRAMER: Why not?

GEORGE: The psychic said something terrible will happen.

KRAMER: I dig.

[Metropolitan Hospital Center - Martin’s room]

KRAMER: I want my vacuum cleaner! I know you can hear me. Look my mother, she’s going to come and visit me. She sees that rug, she’s going to kill me.

W: He can’t hear you, you idiot. Why don’t you just buy another one.

KRAMER: Why would I buy another one when I spent a hundred bucks on this one?

W: I have a carpet sweeper you can use.

KRAMER: I don’t want a carpet sweeper. They don’t do anything.

W: It gets my rug clean.

KRAMER: The carpet sweeper is the biggest scam perpetrated on the American public since One Hour Martinizing.

W: Well, you should take a look at my rug then.

KRAMER: I wouldn’t set foot in your house.

[Jerry enters]

JERRY: Hello.

NEWMAN: Hello Jerry.

JERRY: How’s he doing?

KRAMER: He looks happy to me.

NEWMAN: I hope he stays this happy when he wakes up.

JERRY: Why wouldn’t he?

NEWMAN: No reason.

JERRY: He’ll have a lot of catching up to do, I guess.

NEWMAN: I’ll bring him up to date.

JERRY: How up to date?

NEWMAN: Oh, all the way up.

JERRY: And nothing could change your mind?

NEWMAN: Well, it would take a hell of a lot. Because a friend is something you earn.

KRAMER: Okay, Jerry has a friend who has free tickets to the Cayman Islands for this weekend. He’s not going.

NEWMAN: I don’t care much for the beach. I freckle. . . . Is that a,..

JERRY: Drake’s Coffee Cake

NEWMAN: Wow, where did you get that?

JERRY: From my house. I got a whole box of them.

NEWMAN: Boy, that’s the full size.

JERRY: That’s your big boy.

NEWMAN: Can I have a bite?

JERRY: I don’t give out bites. I got another one. But I’m saving it for later.

NEWMAN: Just one bite?

JERRY: I don’t think so. You know they, they’re so fragile.

NEWMAN: All right! All right. I won’t say anything.

JERRY: You swear?

NEWMAN: I swear.

JERRY: On your mother’s life?

NEWMAN: On my mother’s life.

KRAMER: oh oh oh oh oh

NEWMAN: Oooh,

[Metropolitan Hospital Center - Hallway]

ELAINE: And there it was, mountains of duck. And not fatty duck either, but juicy tender breasts of duck.

[George sees the Psychic’s girl, Faisy and follows her into the Psychic’s room]]

GEORGE: …sweetheart, no come here, … sweetheart

RULA: pew, pew, pew, pew (breathing)

GEORGE: how did I know you were here? Something drew me here. This is phenomenal.

RULA: The nurse said she would be right back. They’re supposed to take me into the delivery room.

GEORGE: Oh, that’s great. That’s great. By the way I have to apologize for my friend the other day. Friend? Uh, uh I don’t even know that woman. I met her on the bus on the way over. I couldn’t get rid of her. Uh, My psychic instincts were a little off ..

RULA: Oh, where’s the nurse

GEORGE: I don’t know where the nurse is. Sweetheart why don’t you get a nurse for mommy? … Anyway I was just curious. Remember the other day you were saying something about my trip.

RULA: Don’t take that trip.

GEORGE: Yeah, why? Why?

RULA: <screams> EEEY, beegit, beegit beegit.

[Doctor enters]

Dx: All right, Rula, it’s time to go.

GEORGE: Because? Because?

[Elaine enters Martins room]

ELAINE: Assassins! How dare they keep a person waiting like this! … Drake’s Coffee Cake? … Give me that.

NEWMAN: Jerry, you better stop her or I’ll tell.

JERRY: Elaine! No! No!

MARTIN: Ooooh, ahhhh,

[In hallway as they wheel Rula to give birth]

GEORGE: Are there terrorists on the plane? A hotel fire. Is that it? Malaria? Yellow fever? Lupus? Is it Lupus?

[Martin’s room – Martin grabbing Jerry – Elaine eating the Drake’s Coffee Cake]

NEWMAN: He did it right in this bed, Martin. Right in front of you.

KRAMER: I want my vacuum cleaner!

JERRY: Hey!

NEWMAN: It was disgusting.

[Jerry’s apartment]

JERRY: What are you doing? We’re going out to dinner in ten minutes.

GEORGE: I never assisted in a birth before. It’s really quite disgusting.

JERRY: What did she name the kid?

GEORGE: You wouldn’t believe it. Rasputin.

[Kramer enters]

KRAMER: Heey!

GEORGE: Hey.

JERRY: Hey.

GEORGE: when did you get back?

KRAMER: A couple of hours ago.

GEORGE: So how was it?

KRAMER: George, I would like to thank you for the greatest four days I ever spent in my life.

JERRY: osh.

KRAMER: They were shooting the Sports Illustrated swim suit issue right in the hotel pool.

JERRY: Woah. [hitting George]

KRAMER: Not only that but at the hotel they opened up this area on the beach for nude bathing and all of the Sports Illustrated models went down there.

JERRY: Wow! [hitting George]

KRAMER: I was on the next blanket from Elle McPherson

JERRY: Oh! [hitting George]

KRAMER: We played Backgammon in the nude.

JERRY: Oh! [hitting George]

KRAMER: She’s a sweet kid.

JERRY: Nude backgammon with swimsuit models!

KRAMER: Oh, you know what? The second day I was there I stepped on a jellyfish. Now it kind of stung my foot. That’s probably what Rula was trying to warn you about.

GEORGE: Yeah, you gotta’ watch for the jellyfish.

KRAMER: Yeah.

KRAMER: What’s this?

JERRY: Oh, it’s an invitation to a house warming from Martin and Gina.

KRAMER: They moved in together?

JERRY: Yeah, it’s some place down in the village.

KRAMER: Phew.

[buzzer]

JERRY: Yeah.

ELAINE: It’s Elaine.

JERRY: All right we’re coming down.

KRAMER: Hey, where ya’ going?

JERRY: We’re taking Elaine to dinner. She’s got to start the fast again. Um, you want to go?

KRAMER: Um, I’d like to but a bunch of us from the islands, we’ll be getting together.

GEORGE: Elle McPherson going to be there?

KRAMER: OH! I got to call her back.

[Kramer exits]

The End

Opening monologue.

I tell ya, I never really understood the importance of the conductor. I mean
between you and me, what the hell is this guy doing? Do you really need
somebody waving a stick in your face to play the violin? Does that really help
you out? I could see how we need him at the beginning. Okay, tap-tap-tap,
start. Okay, I can see how you need that. But once we're going, okay, once
it's all happening, what do we need him for then? I don't see the cellist
looking up, go, "I'm confused. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to
do." And the conductor goes, "Do this. Like this" "Oh, okay, thank you very
much."


First scene.
Jerry and George are seated at a table in a restaurant.

George: Why even try anymore? There's no sense to it. I'm never gonna meet
anybody, I should just accept it.

Jerry: Oh, yes you will.

George: No, I won't.

Jerry: Yeah, maybe you won't.

George: I mean it's hard enough to meet a woman you dislike, much less like.

Jerry: Are my nostrils getting bigger?

George: No. Why must it be so difficult? Why is there all this tension and
hostility? Why can't I just walk up to a woman on the street and say, "Hi. I'm
George. How are you?" Is that so terrible?

Just then a beautiful woman walks past their table, George offers up a meek 'Hi'
which the woman ignores as she passed. George then says 'Hi' a few more times
as he reaches for and drinks from his water glass, as though we was saying that
anyway and it had nothing to do with the woman. (Funnier to watch than read.)


New scene.
Elaine and a friend, Cynthia, are seated at a table in another restaurant.

Cynthia: There's just no men out there, you know?

Elaine: I know.

Cynthia: I mean the problem is that the good ones know they're good. And they
know they're in such demand they're just not interested in confining themselves
to one person.

Elaine: I hate the good ones.

Cynthia: Is Jerry one of the good ones?

Elaine: That's a good question, I think he thinks he is.

Cynthia: Well, the mediocre ones are available, but they're so insecure about
not being one of the good ones that they're always going, "Well I'm not good
enough for you, what are you doing with me?" and eventually I just go, "You're
right."

Elaine: You know, maybe you need somebody between good and mediocre.

Cynthia: No, maybe I need somebody who has nothing, somebody who just has to
appreciate being with me because he's so desperate.


Cut back to George and Jerry, George is eating sloppily.

George: I mean it's gotten to the point where I'm flirting with operators on
the phone. I almost made a date with one.

Jerry: Oh, so there's still hope.

George: I don't want hope. Hope is killing me. My dream is to become
hopeless. When you're hopeless, you don't care, and when you don't care, that
indifference makes you attractive.

Jerry: Oh, so hopelessness is the key.

George: It's my only hope.


Cut back to Elaine and Cynthia.

Cynthia: See, I wouldn't really mind so much, but I feel badly for my mother.
I mean, if my mother weren't around, it wouldn't be so bad. But, I'm telling
you, if I'm not married by the time I'm forty, I'm gonna have to kill her
because it's the only fair thing to do. I just couldn't put her through that.

Elaine: Well, at least you're not bitter.

Cynthia: Who says I'm not bitter?

Elaine: Aren't you too young to be bitter?

Cynthia: No, you can be young and bitter, just maybe not as bitter as I'm gonna
be ten years from now, but I'm bitter. Anyway, don't tell anyone.

Elaine: Don't worry, your bitterness is safe with me.

Cynthia: Um, order me a piece of cake. I'm gonna go throw up.


New scene.
Jerry and Elaine are reading the newspaper at Jerry's apartment.

Jerry: Look at my hands. Look. Filthy from the paper. You know, they should
give you a Wet-nap when you buy one, like at those rib joints.

Elaine: So what'd you do last night?

Jerry: Went out with George, you?

Elaine: Went out with Cynthia.

Jerry: How was it? What'd you talk about?

Elaine: Well, you know, the usual; The Federal Reserve, the rainforest.
Cynthia thought we should nuke the rainforest, you know, get rid of it in one
fell swoop so we can at least eliminate it as a subject of conversation. What
about you?

Jerry: We brushed on that. Actually, George was in rare form. He just can't
find anybody.

Elaine: I know, Cynthia too. She's really given up.

Jerry: George too.

They look at each other for a moment.

Jerry and Elaine (together): Yeah, right.

Jerry: I've never fixed anybody up.

Elaine: Uh, me neither and I am not about to start with George.

Jerry: Well why wouldn't you start with George? You think she's too good for
George?

Elaine: I didn't say 'too good', did I say 'too good'?

Jerry: Well you implied it.

Elaine: I didn't say it.

Jerry: Because if you think she's too good for George, you are dead wrong.
Dead wrong. Who is she?

Elaine: Who is he?

Jerry: He's George!

Elaine: She's Cynthia!

Jerry: So what?

Elaine: What, you don't think she's beautiful?

Jerry: I don't know, what's with the eyebrows?

Elaine: You know what your problem is? Your standards are too high.

Jerry: I went out with you.

Elaine: That's because my standards are too low. And by the way, you know,
women kill for eyebrows like that. Do you know that? I mean women pluck their
real eyebrows out of their head, one by one, until they're bald, Jerry. Bald
above the eyes! And then they paint in these eyebrows to look like that.

Jerry: Well let me tell you something about George. He is fast. He can run
like the wind. And he's strong. I've seen him lift a hundred pounds over his
head without even knowing it. And you wouldn't know it to look at him, but
George can bait a hook.

Elaine: He can really do that?

Jerry: Come on, let's do it, I think they'll really get along.

Elaine: What, are you into this?

Jerry: Yeah, come on, it's a good match.

Elaine: No, wait a minute, wait a minute. They're gonna be telling us how
their dates went. Are we gonna share that information?

Jerry: Naturally.

Elaine: Well, wait a minute, we're gonna tell each other everything, I mean
every secret?

Jerry: Everything.

Elaine: What if it worked out?

Jerry (dialing): Yeah right.


New scene.
Jerry and George are in Jerry's apartment.

George: Out of the question. Out of the question!

Jerry: Why?

George: No! I'm not gonna do that! That's one step away from personal ads!
And prostitutes! No! No, I am not going down that road! What does she look
like?

Jerry: She's good looking.

George: How good looking?

Jerry: Very good looking.

George: Really good looking?

Jerry: Really very good looking.

George: Would you take her out?

Jerry: Yes, I would take her out.

George: Oh, you hesitated.

Jerry: What hesitate? I didn't hesitate!

George: No, something's off here, you hesitated.

Jerry: I'm telling you, she's good looking.

George: What about the body, what kind of body?

Jerry: Good body, nice body.

George: How nice?

Jerry: Nice.

George: Just nice?

Jerry: Pretty nice.

George: Really good?

Jerry: Really very nice and good.

George: What about personality?

Jerry: Good personality. Funny. Bright.

George: Smarter than me? I don't want anyone smarter than me.

Jerry: How could she be smarter than you?

George: Alright, let's see, let's see. What else. What else. Oh yeah, what
does she do?


New scene.
Elaine and Cynthia are having a similar discussion.

Cynthia: First of all, what does he do?

Elaine: He was in real estate, um, now, he's not working right now-

Cynthia: He's not working?! How come he's not working?

Elaine: Well, um, he, he got fired.

Cynthia: Why did he get fired?

Elaine: Uh. Why? Oh, right. Um, well, he tried to poison his boss.

Cynthia: Excuse me?

Elaine: Such a long story, Cynthia, seriously, I mean he just had some problems
at work.

Cynthia: Is he nuts?

Elaine: No, no, no, he's a really really funny guy.

Cynthia: What does he look like?

Elaine: Pardon?

Cynthia: What does he look like?

Elaine: Um, well, he's got a lot of character in his face. Um, he's short.
Um, he's stocky.

Cynthia: Fat. Is that what you're saying, that he's fat?

Elaine: Powerful. He is so powerful, he can lift a hundred pounds right up
over his head. And um, what else. What else. Oh, right. Um, well, he's kind
of, just kind of losing his hair.

Cynthia: He's bald?

Elaine: No! No, no, no, he's not bald. He's balding.

Cynthia: So he will be bald.

Elaine: Yup.


Cut back to Jerry and George.

George: What kind of hair?

Jerry: You know, long dark hair.

George: Flowing?

Jerry: Flowing?

George: Is it flowing? I like flowing, cascading hair. Thick lustrous hair is
very important to me.

Jerry: 'Thick lustrous hair is very important to me,' is that what you said?

George: Yeah, that's right.

Jerry: Just clarifying.

George: Let me ask you this. If you stick your hand in the hair is it easy to
get it out?

Jerry: Do you want to be able to get it out or do you want to not be able to
get it out?

George: I'd like to be able to get it out.

Jerry: I think you'll get it out.

George: What about the skin? I need a good cheek, I like a good cheek.

Jerry: She's got a fine cheek.

George: Is there a pinkish hue?

Jerry: A pinkish hue?

George: Yes, a rosy glow.

Jerry: There's a hue. She's got great eyebrows, women kill to have her
eyebrows.

George: Who cares about eyebrows? Is she sweet? I like sweet. But not too
sweet, you could throw up from that.

Jerry: I don't think you'll throw up. *She* likes to throw up.


Cut back to Elaine and Cynthia.

Cynthia: Has he ever been married?

Elaine: No.

Cynthia: Has he been close?

Elaine: He once spent a weekend with a woman.

Cynthia: He didn't really try to poison his boss?

Elaine: Yeah, he did.


New scene.
The next day, George is back at Jerry's.

George: We had an incredible phone conversation. We talked for like twenty
minutes. I threw away my notes in the middle of the call. You know, I thought
she had a great voice timbre. Is it timbre or tamber?

Jerry: I think it's tamber.

George: Why'd I think it was timbre? Yeah, she could do voiceover commercials,
why didn't you tell me about her voice?

Jerry: I didn't notice the voice.

George: It's mellifluous!

Jerry: So, Saturday night.

George: She had to be impressed by that conversation, had to! It was a great
performance. I am unbelievable on the phone. On the date they should just have
two phones on the table at the restaurant, done.

Elaine enters.

Elaine: Hi.

George: Hey! Saturday night!

Elaine: I know!

George: So, what did she say?

Elaine: She said you're getting together Saturday night!

George: That's it?

Elaine: Yeah!

George: She didn't mention anything about the conversation?

Elaine: No.

George: Now, you see, I don't get that. We had a relaxed stimulating, great
conversation, she doesn't mention it? Why doesn't she mention it?

Elaine: What?

Jerry: She could have mentioned the conversation.

George: Alright, alright, I'll go on the date, but that's that.

Kramer enters.

Kramer: Hey.

Jerry: Hey.

Kramer: You know my friend, Bob Sacamano?

Jerry: Oh, the guy from Jersey?

Kramer: Yeah. He just got a job at a condom factory in Edison. Look at this,
he gave me a gross.

George: What are you gonna do with all of them?

Kramer: Oh, well... Come on, take some, Jerry. Grab 'em.

Jerry: No thanks, they look like they came out of a cereal box.

Kramer: Come on, Elaine, here, take half a bag.

Elaine: Half a bag? What am I, a hooker? Anyway, they look kind of cheap.

George: I'll take one. It's possible.


Mid-episode monologue.

The problem with the condom is still buying them. I think we should have like a
secret signal with the druggist that you just walk into the drugstore, you go up
to the counter, he looks at you and if you go like this (nods) he puts them in
the bag for you, that's it. You show up there, you put your little shaving
cream, your little toothpaste, you know, "How are you today?" (nods) "Have a
nice day." "You too."


New scene.
Elaine and Jerry are on the phone, waiting for George and Cynthia's date to end.

Jerry: So where are they already, it's a quarter to twelve, they should be back
by now, what did they do?

Elaine: I think they went out to dinner.

Jerry: Wait, I got another call. That must be him. [clicks over] Hello?

George: Yeah, it's me, I just got home.

Jerry: Oh, hold on. [clicks back] It's George, he just got home.

Elaine: Yeah, yeah, I got Cynthia on the other line.

Jerry: Alright, I'll call you back as soon as I'm done.

Elaine: Remember our pact. Full disclosure.

Jerry: Of course. [clicks back to George] Yeah, go ahead.

George: Alright look, I'm gonna tell you, but I made a pact with Cynthia, we
swore we were not going to tell you and Elaine.

Jerry: You can tell me, I'll vault it.

George: It's in the vault?

Jerry: I'm locking the vault. What?

George: We had sex.

Jerry: Oh my god, you had sex, how did that happen?

George: I don't know. I closed my eyes and made a move.

Jerry: At your apartment?

George: Yeah.

Jerry: She didn't stay over?

George: No, she left. Listen, you can't mention any of this to Elaine.
Cynthia will kill me, we made a deal.

Cut to Elaine on the phone with Cynthia.

Elaine: Oh my god.

Cynthia: He was uncomfortable because it was our first time so he felt he would
perform better if we did it in the kitchen. He said the kitchen is always the
most sociable room in the house. And he was serious.

Elaine: So? How was it?

Cynthia: How good could it be? My head was on a hot plate.

Elaine: Wait, I got another call, that must be Jerry.

Cynthia: Oh wait, don't you tell him any of this.

Elaine: Yeah, ok. [clicks over] Hello?

Jerry: So, what did she have to say?

Elaine: What did he have to say?

Jerry: He said they had a good time.

Elaine: Her too.

Jerry: Oh, good.

Elaine: Anything else?

Jerry: Nope. You?

Elaine: Nope.

Jerry: You sure?

Elaine: Yup. You?

Jerry: Yeah.

Elaine: Alright. Well uh, guess everything is under control.

Jerry: Yeah. Okay then.

Elaine: Alright. Goodnight.

Jerry: Goodnight.


New scene.
Jerry and George are at Jerry's apartment.

George: I left three messages. I can't believe this woman. She has sex with
me, leaves ten minutes later then I never hear from her again. What kind of a
person does this? I mean, she used me. I feel cheap and violated.

Jerry: Well, I'm gonna do something about this.

George: What are you gonna do?

Jerry: Nevermind. Disgraceful. Leaves you sitting there on the kitchen floor
like some kind of roach trap. Wham, bam, thank you ma'am. Sir, whatever.
She's not going to get away with this.

George: I keep wracking my brain to try and figure out what I did. I was
smart, I was funny, I made great small talk with the waitress so she could see I
could relate to the commoners, you know, I'm a man of the people.

Jerry: I'm gonna call her.

George: No, don't call her.

Jerry: No, I'm calling her.

George: No, Jerry, don't call.

Jerry: No, forget it, I'm gonna call.

George: I don't want you to call.

Jerry: Get away from me, I'm gonna call her.

George: Give me the phone!

Jerry: George, do you wanna fight? Do you wanna fight?

George: Jerry, I'm gonna kill you!

Kramer enters and gets between them to break up the fight.

Kramer: Hey hey hey!! Come on! Jerry, George, now stop it!

Jerry: I'll just call her when you leave!

George: You can't do that, it's none of your business!

Jerry: It is so my business!

Kramer: Hey hey hey! I don't want to hear another word out of either one of
you!


George: But tell him to give me the--

Kramer: Ay ay ay! The next one of you that opens up your mouth, says
something, you're gonna have to deal with me. You know, I bet I know what this
is about. It's about a woman, isn't it?

George: No.

Jerry: Yeah, but--

Kramer: Yeah yeah! You see, this is exactly what they want to do to you. They
play one against the other. You can't let them manipulate you like that.

Jerry: But Kramer--

Kramer: Noh noh noh! I want you guys to shake hands. Come on, there are
plenty of women out there for all of us, let's go.

Jerry and George shake hands.

Kramer: Yes. You see? Isn't that better than fighting? Animosity? I mean,
you wanna fight with somebody, you fight with me. Oh, by the way George, you
know those condoms I gave you? They're defective, don't use them.

George: What?

Kramer: Right.

George: Defective?!

Kramer: Defective.

George (attacking Kramer): How could you give me a defective condom?!

Kramer: I didn't even know they were defective.

Jerry gets between them to break up the fight.

Kramer: Didn't even thin you were gonna use them.

George: What do you mean you didn't think I wasn't gonna use them?!

Jerry: Take it easy, you guys, just spread out! Don't worry about it, if
anything was wrong she would have called you already!


New scene.
Elaine answers her door, it's Cynthia.

Cynthia: I missed my period.

Elaine: Oh my god.

Cynthia: I am very worried, I am never late.

Elaine: But he used a condom, right?

Cynthia: I know, but these things aren't always foolproof.

Elaine: Oh no.

Cynthia: What?

Elaine: Was it blue?

Cynthia: Yeah. How'd you know?

Elaine: Just a hunch.


New scene.
Jerry is in his apartment trying to open a bottle of soda.

Jerry: Ow! Ow! Twist off! Twist off! Twist off!

Elaine walks in and give him a funny look.

Jerry: Oh, hi. Soda?

Elaine: No thanks.

Jerry: So tell me. What's the problem with your little flaky friend? She
doesn't return calls?

Elaine: Who are you to talk about her like that? She'll call him when she's
good and ready. You don't even know her.

Jerry: Oh, I know her. I know her type.

Elaine: Her type? What type?

Jerry: The type that doesn't return phone calls. I knew we shouldn't have done
this, it was a bad idea in the first place, I told you!

Elaine: You told me? You pushed this whole thing on me, it was your idea!

Jerry: I was just trying to help your bitter, twisted friend.

Elaine: She's not bitter!

Jerry: Well, bitter's a judgement call, but she's twisted!

Elaine: Twisted? God, I did you a favor.

Jerry: I thought you said they had a good time, is there anything else you're
keeping from me?

Elaine: Are you calling me a liar?

Jerry: I'm calling you one if you are one, are you a liar?

Elaine: Are you?

Jerry: Get your finger out of my face.

Elaine: You get yours out, I was here first!

Jerry: I don't care.

Elaine: Get it out!

Kramer walks in just as this argument begins to turn into a slap fight, and gets
in the middle.

Kramer: Hey hey, alright, hey hey, stop it! Come on, break it up! What's the
matter with you? Now don't you two see that you're in love with each other? I
mean, why can't you face that already? You're running around out there looking
for something that's not even there, when everything that you dream of is right
here, right here in front of you. Now why can't you admit that? By the way,
when you see George give him these, these'll work.

Elaine: I knew those condoms were defective!

Jerry: How did you know they were defective?!

George walks in.

Elaine: Because! Because she missed her period!

George: She missed her period? Oh my god. I can't believe it! I'm a father!
I did it! My boys can swim! I can do it! I can do it!

George rushes out, hysterical.


New scene.
Elaine and Cynthia are at a restaurant.

Cynthia: So he shows up. He's all out of breath. He's disheveled. And he
tells me that no matter what happens, whatever I decide is fine with him and
that I could depend on him, and that he would be there to support me in whatever
way I need. Elaine, I was speechless.

Elaine: Wow. Wow. You see? You think you know somebody.

Cynthia: I said to him, "I really appreciate this, but I just got my period."
And so, I asked him to come in, he came in--

George and Jerry walk up, Jerry is limping.

Elaine: Hi!

George: Sorry, we're a little late. We got so hung up in traffic.

Elaine: What happened?

Jerry: Acting.

Elaine: Very mature.

Jerry: Thank you. Hi Cynthia.

Cynthia: Hi.

Jerry: Well this is a great place to sit you got here.

Cynthia: Best seat in the house. (Looking at George) right next to the
kitchen.

George (hitting Cynthia playfully with a napkin): Stop it, stop it.

Jerry: So what are these?

Elaine: Oh, we ordered some appetizers. Start eating.

George stars eating like a slob, Cynthia looks at him funny. You get the idea
that the relationship has just ended.

George (with a mouth full of food): This is good. Oh, this is good.


Closing monologue.

Have you ever fixed anybody up? Why do we do it? Why? You thought they would
have a good time. And a little power trip for you, isn't it? Now, you're
playing god. Of course god was the first person to fix people up. He fixed up
Adam and Eve. You know, I'm sure he said to Adam, "She's nice. She's very free
about her body, doesn't really wear that much. She was going out with a snake,
I think that's over though."

STAND UP
=========
To me, going to the health club, you see all these people and they're
working out, and they're training and they're getting in shape but the
strange thing is nobody is really getting in shape for anything. The only
reason that you're getting in shape is that so you can get through the
workout. So we're working out, so that we'll be in shape, for when we have
to do our exercise. This is the whole thing. The other thing I don't get
about it, is why we're so careful about locking up our dirty towels and
smelly jock-straps. What exactly is the black market on these disgusting gym
clothes? I give my car to any valet guy in front of a restaraunt because he
has a short red jacket, yeah he must be the valet guy, I don't even think
about it but my stinking, putrified gym clothes, I got one of these locks
you could put a bullet through it and it won't open. That stuff is safe.


[Gym Locker Room]

KRAMER: Wide open, I was wide open underneath! I had three inches on that
guy. You two were hogging the ball.

GEORGE: Me? It wasn't me I never even saw the ball. All you do is dribble.

JERRY: I have to dribble, if I give it to you, you just shoot. You're a
chucker.

GEORGE: Oh I'm a chucker.

JERRY: That's right, everytime you get the ball you shoot.

GEORGE: I can't believe you called me a chucker. No way I'm a chucker, I do
not chuck, never chucked, never have chucked, never will chuck, no chuck!

JERRY: You chuck.

GEROGE: Kramer am I a chucker?


KRAMER: You're a chucker.

GEORGE: All these years I've been chuckin' and you've never told me?

JERRY: Well it's not an easy thing to bring up.

KRAMER: Hey you know this is the first time we've ever seen each other naked.

JERRY: Believe me I didn't see anything.

KRAMER: Oh, you didn't sneak a peak?

JERRY: No, did you?

KRAMER: Yeah, I snuck a peak.

JERRY: Why?

KRAMER: Why not? hey what about you George?

GEORGE: yeah, I ... I snuck a peak. ... But it was so fast I didn't see
anything. It was just a blur.

JERRY: I made a conscious effort not to look. There's certain information I just
don't want to have.

KRAMER: Uh, I gotta go meet Newman. All right. I'll see you later.

JERRY: All right

KRAMER: Have a good one.

JERRY: All right

GEORGE: See ya.

[Kramer exits]

GEORGE: look at this guy. Does he have to stretch in here?

JERRY: You know who that is? That's

GEORGE: Keith Hernandez? The baseball player?

JERRY: Yeah, that's him.

GEORGE: Are you sure?

JERRY: Positive.

GEORGE: Wow, Keith Hernandez. He's such a great player.

JERRY: Yeah, he's a real smart guy too. He's a Civil War buff.

GEORGE: I'd love to be a Civil War buff. ... What do you have to do to be a buff

JERRY: So Biff wants to be a buff? ... Well sleeping less than 18 hours a day
would be a start.

GEORGE: ho ho ho ho. You know I only got two weeks left of unemployment. I got
to prove I've been looking for a job to get an extension

JERRY: Hey, should we say something to him?

GEORGE: Oh, yeah I'm sure he loves to hear from fans in the locker room.

JERRY: well he could say hello to me. I wouldn't mind.

GEORGE: He's Keith Hernandez. You're Jerry Seinfeld.

JERRY: So?

GEORGE: What are you comparing yourself to Keith Hernandez. The guys a baseball
player Jerry, Baseball!

JERRY: I know what he is. I recognized him. You didn't even notice him.

GEORGE: What, ... you are making some wisecracks in a night club... wo wo wo.
The guy was in game SIX two runs down two outs facing elimination.

KEITH: Excuse me. I don't want to disturb you, I'm Keith Hernandez and I just
want to tell you what a big fan I am. I love your comedy.

JERRY: Really?

KEITH: I've always wanted to do what you do.

JERRY: What I do? You are one of my favorite ball players of all time

GEORGE: Mine too.

KEITH: I love that bit about Jimmy Olson

JERRY: Thank you.

GEORGE: You know Keith, what I've always wondered, with all these ball clubs
flying around all season don't you think there would be a plane crash? ...

KEITH: (to Jerry) Do you perform anywhere in new York right now?

JERRY: I'm performing in this club on the east Side. You should come in.

GEORGE: But if you think about it...26 teams, 162 games a season, you'd think
eventually an entire team would get wiped out.

KEITH: You know, I live on the East Side.

JERRY: I'll tell you what, I'll give you my number and uh, just give me a call,
tell me whenever you want to go.

KEITH: or maybe just to get together for a cup of coffee

JERRY: Oh. that would be great.

GEORGE: Uh, it's only a matter of time.

KEITH: Who's this chucker?

[Monks]

JERRY: It's been three days and he hasn't called.

ELAINE: Well maybe you should call him.

JERRY: I can't ... I can't

ELAINE: Why not?

JERRY: I don't know. I just feel he should call me.

ELAINE: What's the difference?

JERRY: You don't understand, Elaine. I don't want to be overanxious. If he wants
to see me he has my number, he should call.

ELAINE: Yech, look at this ashtray. I hate cigarettes.

JERRY: I can't stand these guys. You give your number to them and then they
don't call. Why do they do that?

ELAINE: I'm sorry honey.

JERRY: I mean, I thought he liked me. I really thought he liked me. we were
getting along. He came over to me I didn't go over to him.

ELAINE: No,

JERRY: Why did he come over to me if he didn't want to see me?

ELAINE: I know.

JERRY: What did he come over to me if he didn't want to see me? I mean here I
meet this guy this great guy, a baseball player, best guy I ever met in my life.
.. Well that's it. I'm never giving my number out to another guy again.

ELAINE: Sometimes I've given my number out to guys and it takes them a month to
call.

JERRY: Hu, good, good,... well if he's calling in a month he's got a prayer!

ELAINE: You know maybe he's been busy. Maybe he's been out of town?

JERRY: Oh, they don't have phones out of town? Why do(?) people say they're
too busy. Too busy. Pick up a phone!! It takes two minutes. How can you be
too busy?

ELAINE: Why don't you just go ahead and call him?

JERRY: I can't call here, it's a coffee shop. I mean what am I going to say to
him?

ELAINE: Just ask him if he wants a to get together.

JERRY: For what dinner?

ELAINE: Dinner's good.

JERRY: Don't you think that's coming on a little too strong? .. Isn't that like
a turn off?

ELAINE: Jerry, He's A GUY!

JERRY: ... this is all .. very confusing.

STAND UP
=========
When you're in your thirties it's very hard to make a new friend. Whatever the
group is that you've got now that's who you're going with. you're not
interviewing, you're not looking at any new people, you're not interested in
seeing any applications. They don't know the places. They don't know the food.
They don't know the activities, If I meet a guy in a club on the gym or
someplace I'm sure you're a very nice person you seem to have a lot of
potential, but we're just not hiring right now. Of course when you're a kid,
you can be friends with anybody. Remember when you were a little kid what were
the qualifications? If someone's in front of my house NOW, That's my friend,
they're my friend. That's it. Are you a grown up.? No. Great! Come on in. Jump
up and down on my bed. And if you have anything in common at all, You like
Cherry Soda? I like Cherry Soda! We'll be best friends!

looking as the listening. I listen for work. And as I'm looking and listening I

us to see the baby.

JERRY: (imitates) Ya' gotta see the babi - When are ya' gonna see the babi...
Can't they just send us a tape?

ELAINE: You know if you waited a few more months it won't be a baby anymore

JERRY: uh uh because then it would be all grown up.

ELAINE: yeah ha ha ha

JERRY: Hey Kramer what do you think of this shirt?

KRAMER: (does a double take) It's too busy

ELAINE: It looks like you're trying too hard to make an impression on him.
You're not being yourself.

KRAMER: What guy?

JERRY: I know he's just a guy but .. I LIKE him.

KRAMER: Who are you talkin about?

JERRY: Uh, Keith uh Hernandez.

KRAMER: KEITH HERNANDEZ?

NEWMAN: [enters] KEITH HERNANDEZ?


[In cab]

GEORGE: Do me a favor would you? Would you change lanes? Would you get outta

CABBY: Get out of my cab.

[Cabby gets out]

GEORGE: No, no! You can't throw me out

[Wrestling in cab]

[Jerry's Apartment]

JERRY: Hellooo Newman.

KRAMER: I hate KEITH HERNANDEZ - hate him.

NEWMAN: I despise him.

ELAINE: Why?

NEWMAN: Why? I'll tell you why...

KRAMER: Let me tell it ..

NEWMAN: No, you can't tell it ..

KRAMER: You always tell it ..

NEWMAN: All right, tell it.

KRAMER: Ja ja ja - just tell it

NEWMAN: June 14, 1987.... Mets Phillies. We're enjoying a beautiful afternoon
in the right field stands when a crucial Hernandez error to a five run Phillies
ninth. Cost the Mets the game.

KRAMER: Our day was ruined. There was a lot of people, you know, they were
waiting by the player's parking lot. Now we're coming down the ramp ... [cut
to film of the day - like the Zabruter film - with the Umbrella man and
everything - Oh so brilliant parody!!!] ... Newman was in front of me. Keith
was coming toward us, as he passes Newman turns and says, " Nice game pretty
boy.". Keith continued past us up the ramp.

NEWMAN: A second later, something happened that changed us in a deep and
profound way front that day forward.

ELAINE: What was it?

KRAMER: He spit on us.... and I screamed out, "I'm hit!"

NEWMAN: Then I turned and the spit ricochet of him and it hit me.

ELAINE: Wow! What a story.

JERRY: Unfortunately the immutable laws of physics contradict the whole premise
of your account. Allow me to reconstruct this if I may for Miss Benes as
I've heard this story a number of times.

JERRY: Newman, Kramer, if you'll indulge me. According to your story Keith
passes you and starts walking up the ramp then you say you were struck on
the right temple. The spit then proceeds to ricochet off the temple
striking Newman between the third and forth rib. The spit then cam off
the rib turned and hit Newman in the right wrist causing him to drop his
baseball cap. The spit then splashed off the wrist, Pauses In mid air
mind you- makes a left turn and lands on Newman's left thigh. That is one
magic luggie.

[THE BRILLIANCE OF THIS SCENE IS THAT IT IS AN EXACT PARODY OF KEVIN COSTNER'S COURTROOM SCENE IN
THE FILM JFK - AND WAYNE KNIGHT PLAYED THE SAME POSITION IN BOTH!!!]

NEWMAN: Well that's the way it happened.

JERRY: What happened to your head when you got hit?

KRAMER: Well. uh, well my head went back and to the left

JERRY: Again

KRAMER: Back and to the left

JERRY: Back and to the left Back and to the left

ELAINE: So, what are you saying?

JERRY: I am saying that the spit could not have come from behind ... that there had to have been
a second spitter behind the bushes on the gravelly road. If the spitter was behind you as you claimed
that would have caused your head to pitch forward.

ELAINE: So the spit could have only come from the front and to the right.

JERRY: But that is not what they would have you believe.

NEWMAN: I'm leavin'. Jerry's a nut. [Exits]

KRAMER: Wait, wait, [Exits]

JERRY: The sad thing is we may never know the real truth.

[George runs in]

GEORGE: [Frantically] Did anybody call here asking for Vandaley industries?

JERRY: No. What happened to you?

GEORGE: Now, listen closely. I was at the unemployment office and I told them that I was very close
to getting a job with Vandaley Industries and I gave them your phone number. So, when now when the phone
rings you've got to answer "Vanadaley Industries".

JERRY: I'm Vanadaley Industries?

GEORGE: Right.

JERRY: And what is that?

GEORGE: You're in latex

JERRY: Latex? And what do I do with latex?

GEORGE: Ya manufacture it.

ELAINE: Here in this little apartment?

JERRY: And what do I say about you?

GEORGE: You're considering hiring me for your latex salesman.

JERRY: I'm going to hire you as my latex salesman?

GEORGE: Right.

JERRY: I don't think so. Why would I do that?

GEORGE: Because I asked you to.

JERRY: If you think I'm looking for someone to just sit at a desk pushing papers
around, you can forget it. I have enough headaches just trying to
manufacture the stuff.

[Buzzer]

JERRY: Yeah.

KRAMER: It's Keith.

JERRY: All right we're coming down.

GEORGE: KEITH HERNANDEZ:?

JERRY: Yeah, come on Elaine, lets go.

GEORGE: Where are you goin?

ELAINE: He's giving me a ride You know there had to have been a second spitter.
But who was it? Who had the motive?

JERRY: That's what I've been trying to figure out the past five years.

GEORGE: What the hell are you two talking about? [All exit]


[Keith's car]

JERRY: Well that was really fun, thanks.

KEITH: Yeah, it really was.
